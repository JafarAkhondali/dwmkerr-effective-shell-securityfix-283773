For example, in the screenshot below I have tried to use Ctrl + V a few times to paste into terminal on Ubuntu: Instead of the contents of the clipboard being dropped into the shell, we see the text ^V. Why is this? Well, some of this is historical (the shell has been around for a long time so we'll see this answer a lot!). The reason the Ctrl key is called the Control Key is that it is used to send control sequences to the computer. When we're using the Control Key, the characters we send are not plain text, they're used to perform actions. This is something that is probably pretty familiar. For example, Ctrl + P is almost universally used as a shortcut for the 'Print' command. We tend to think of these commands as shortcuts to save us from finding the appropriate command in a menu or on a toolbar. But of course most shells and command-line interfaces pre-date graphical user interfaces. They needed a way to differentiate between a user entering plain old text, and a user wanting to execute a certain command. Even modern shells tend to follow the conventions around control sequences which were established by earlier ones to ensure a consistent experience for users who are used to working with shells. Shells have a whole bunch of control sequences which actually pre-date the graphical user interface, the clipboard itself, and even screens! Some of the control sequences used in the shell you might already be familiar with. For example, if you have a program running and want to cancel it, you might be used to using Ctrl + C. This actually sends a signal to the program and typically the program responds by closing. We'll see signals again and again as we go through the book. The Ctrl + C combination terminates the current program. What about Ctrl + V? This is the grand-sounding \"Verbatim Insert\" command. It tells the shell to write out the next keystroke you give it. This allows you to write out 'special' characters like the escape key, left or right keys, or even the Ctrl + V combination itself. So if you type Ctrl + V twice, the shell writes out the text ^V. The hat symbol ^ represents Ctrl. The first command tells the shell to write out the following command, the second is then written out directly. You can try writing out some different sequences. You'll see various odd looking symbols drawn, which represent things like the Alt key and other special keys. So why do we need to care? Well the shell already has a command for Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V, so we're going to need to work around this to use our familiar 'copy' and 'paste' commands. How this works varies across platforms. Follow the instructions below for the platform you are using. Windows If you are using a Command Prompt, then the usual shortcuts will work fine. However, most of the time we will be using Bash. In this case the shortcuts will not work. Instead, select the Use Ctrl+Shift+C/V as Copy/Paste option from the properties menu: You can now use Ctrl+Shift+C for copy and Ctrl+Shift+V for paste. You can also copy text by just dragging the cursor over it with the right mouse button. Linux On most Linux systems you'll be using the Gnome terminal, which means that you can use Ctrl+Shift+C for copy and Ctrl+Shift+V for paste. You can also right click on text with the cursor to select it. MacOS Mac users can just use ⌘ + C for copy and ⌘ + V for paste. The shell doesn't use the special Mac Command character ⌘, which means the default keyboard mappings on MacOS work fine in a shell as they do not clash with anything. Now that we've got the basics out of the way, and learnt far more than we probably wanted to about control keys, we can look at more ways to use the clipboard.","s":"The Clipboard Essentials","u":"/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/become-a-clipboard-gymnast/","h":"#the-clipboard-essentials","p":16},{"i":21,"t":"Copying and pasting text to and from the clipboard is useful, but there's a lot more we can do. With a couple of basic commands we can hugely expand what we can do with the shell and make a whole set of everyday tasks far easier to accomplish. There is one small complexity we'll need to work through before we continue. The complexity is that the clipboard is accessed in different ways on Windows, Linux and MacOS. I'll first show you how to deal with this, just follow the instructions for the platform you are working on. To make things easier for the reader I'm going to assume you have created the pbcopy and pbpaste commands by following the instructions below. I am creating these commands so that regardless of the platform you are using the tutorials will work in the same way! Windows Assuming you are using WSL, you will need to run the following two commands. By the time this book is published there may be a cleaner way, but for now this is a workaround for some limitations on the WSL system: alias pbcopy='clip.exe'alias pbpaste=\"powershell.exe -command 'Get-Clipboard' | tr -d '\\r' | head -n -1\" Don't worry about how these commands work - by the time you've gone through the book it should make perfect sense. For now you just need to know we're adding two new commands to our toolkit - pbcopy and pbpaste, which will work in Bash on Windows. Linux Hopefully if you are Linux user the commands below will seem familiar. They install the xclip program and create shortcuts to copy and paste. You absolutely don't need to do this if you prefer to call xclip directly, these commands are just setup so that across all platforms the tutorial looks the same. sudo apt install -y xclipalias pbcopy=\"xclip -selection c\"alias pbpaste=\"xclip -selection c -o\" MacOS Nothing is required on MacOS - pbcopy and pbpaste are built in. Making these changes permanent We've used the alias command to create pbcopy and pbpaste. In Bash (and most shells) an alias is something you can configure as a shortcut to avoid having to type longer commands. There's a whole chapter on commands in Section 2. These instructions will need to be repeated when you re-open your terminal. In a later chapter we'll see how to make permanent customisations to our shells so that we don't have to repeat this setup. We'll also see later on how to create configuration which works across many different platforms, so that you can use the same configuration regardless of what platform you are working on. This is very useful if you work across multiple machines or operating systems!","s":"Preparing the Clipboard Commands","u":"/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/become-a-clipboard-gymnast/","h":"#preparing-the-clipboard-commands","p":16},{"i":23,"t":"Now that we've created these commands, we can use them to access the clipboard. For example, if I copy the following text: Kirk Van HoutenTimothy LovejoyArtie Ziff Then I can paste it into the shell with the following command: pbpaste And we'll see something like this: Copying is just as straightforward. If you have downloaded the Effective Shell 'samples' folder you can see we have a list of characters from \"The Simpsons\" in the file effective-shell/text/simpsons-characters.txt. Now we could use the cat command to show the contents of the file, and then manually select the text and copy it. Even easier though is to just pipe the contents of the file to the pbcopy command: cat ~/effective-shell/text/simpsons-characters.txt | pbcopy The output will look similar to the below (I've included the output of cat for reference as well): The vertical bar | is the pipe operator. It tells the shell to take the output from the command on the left and send it straight to the input of the program on the right. We're going to see a lot more of the pipeline operator as we continue. For now it's enough to know you can use it to 'chain' commands together. This might not seem super useful so far - but if the text file was a lot larger then it would be much harder to cat it out, use the mouse to select all of the text (scrolling up through the window) and then copy it. And if you didn't have a mouse, it would be even more tricky. We're aiming to be as effective as possible when using the shell so being able to use the keyboard quickly for common tasks is critical. Now we can see some real world examples of how these commands can be useful in daily tasks!","s":"Copy and Paste Basics","u":"/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/become-a-clipboard-gymnast/","h":"#copy-and-paste-basics","p":16},{"i":25,"t":"Don't you hate it when you have to copy formatted text and don't have an easy way to paste it as unformatted text?

If you just run the command pbpaste | pbcopy, you can easily strip the formatting: We're just piping out the clipboard (which ends up as plain text, cause we're in a terminal!) and then piping that plain text back into the clipboard, replacing the formatted text which was there before. This little trick can be very useful. But we can use the same pattern to quickly manipulate the contents of the clipboard in more sophisticated ways.","s":"Removing Formatting","u":"/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/become-a-clipboard-gymnast/","h":"#removing-formatting","p":16},{"i":27,"t":"Because we can pipe the contents of the clipboard to other programs, that means we can easily use the huge number of tools available to us to work with text.

We'll be going into them in detail as the book continues, and in the next chapter we'll be looking into how you can get help directly in the shell to discover how commands work. The key concept is that you can treat the clipboard just like a file - reading from it, manipulating it, and writing back to it, without ever leaving the shell. In fact - if you are on a Linux system, try running: cat /dev/clipboard You'll see the contents of the clipboard written out. In Linux almost everything can be represented as a file - the clipboard included! Like a lot of the other topics this is something we'll visit again in detail later. We're also going to spend a lot of time later on looking at pipelines in detail, so don't worry too much if this seems overwhelming at this stage! As you go through the book you'll be able to apply every technique you learn to the clipboard itself - hopefully you'll find this can save you a lot of time and make you even faster with your day to day work.","s":"Manipulating Text","u":"/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/become-a-clipboard-gymnast/","h":"#manipulating-text","p":16},{"i":31,"t":"In this chapter we learnt: You can copy and paste into the shell with keyboard commands which are the same, or at least very similar, to the commands you normally use.

We can 'chain' commands together with the | (pipe) operator. We can turn formatted text on the clipboard into plain text by just running pbpaste | pbcopy. We can sort lines of text with the sort command. There is clearly a lot more we can do with text as we save hints of with the uniq, tr and sed commands - which we'll introduce in detail later. You can treat the clipboard a bit like a file in the shell. On Linux, lots of things can be represented as files - including the clipboard (which is accessed via the /dev/clipboard file).","s":"Summary","u":"/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/become-a-clipboard-gymnast/","h":"#summary","p":16},{"i":33,"t":"On this page","s":"Getting Started","u":"/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/getting-started/","h":"","p":32},{"i":35,"t":"If you don't know what the shell is, then this is the place to start! When we talk about \"The Shell\", we're normally referring to the simple, text-based interface which is used to control a computer or a program. Here's what the shell looks like on Windows: And here's what it looks like on a Mac: And here's what it looks like on Fedora, a popular Linux distribution: When we are talking about the shell in this book, we're talking about the simple program which can be used to operate the computer using this text based interface. Why would you want to do this? There are a few reasons! Firstly, using the shell can help you learn more about the internals of how your computer can work. This can be really helpful if you are a technology professional or work with computers. Secondly, there are some scenarios where you have to use a shell. Not every program or system can be operated with a Graphical User Interface, which is the visual point-and-click interface you are probably using now. Some lower-level programs do not have such interfaces, and many computers do not either. Finally, there are some scenarios where it can be more efficient to use the shell. Operations which might be time consuming or repetitive to perform using the user interface might be much faster to perform in a shell. You can also write shell scripts to automate these kinds of operations. In the next section you'll learn how to startup the shell on your computer. Once this is done you are ready to continue with the book.","s":"What is the Shell?","u":"/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/getting-started/","h":"#what-is-the-shell","p":32},{"i":37,"t":"Now let's actually learn how to open the shell on your computer. Once we've done this, we might need to make some configuration changes so that we get it to behave in a way which as consistent with other shells as possible - we'll get to that in the next chapter.","s":"Opening the Shell","u":"/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/getting-started/","h":"#opening-the-shell","p":32},{"i":39,"t":"There are a number of shell programs on Microsoft Windows. We'll be using the basic shell which is pre-installed, which is called the \"Command Prompt\". To open the command prompt, start by clicking the start button on the bottom left hand side of the screen, and type command prompt. Open the Command Prompt program: Once the program has opened, type whoami then hit the Return key. The whoami program will show the username of the logged in user: That's it! We've still got some configuration to do to make this shell behave more like a Linux shell, which this book uses as the standard, but we'll come to that in the next section.","s":"Microsoft Windows","u":"/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/getting-started/","h":"#microsoft-windows","p":32},{"i":41,"t":"If you are using a Mac, then you just need to run the \"Terminal\" program to open your shell.

In general, Linux systems tend to use the \"Bash\" shell and require little configuration. Apple's MacOS operating system is actually based on BSD Unix, and under the hood is somewhat different to most Linux systems. Microsoft Windows is a completely unrelated operating system to either Linux or Unix and operates in a fundamentally different way from both of them. In this book, we assume that you are using a \"Linux-like\" system, something which operates like a modern Linux distribution. This is a deliberate choice. If you become comfortable using a Linux-like shell, you can generally apply the techniques we'll show to MacOS with no difficulties. For Windows, the techniques are not necessarily transferable immediately, but still valuable to know. Windows is actually being updated at the time of writing to provide a Linux-like shell interface as part of the core operating system (this is known as the Windows Subsystem for Linux. As time progresses it will be easier to run commands using the techniques in this book natively, but for now we'll have to tweak a few things. In this section we'll make sure that we are running with a setup which is close to Linux, and aim to set the latest version of our shell to the popular \"Bash\" program. If you are familiar with Bash but prefer to use another shell, that is fine, most of the book will work with any modern shell. However, if you are not sure what shell you should be using, I would recommend you follow the guides below to setup the most popular shell at its latest version. Once this is done then we are ready to get into the book properly!","s":"Configuring the Shell","u":"/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/getting-started/","h":"#configuring-the-shell","p":32},{"i":47,"t":"Windows is not anything like Linux under the hood. So to get a shell working, we have three options: Use a tool which provides common Linux tools which have been written to work with Windows Use a \"virtual machine\" running Linux Use the Windows Subsystem for Linux The first option is the best if you want to actually be able to work with the files on your computer quickly and easily day to day. The second option is best if you want to be able to experiment with the shell, but keep it completely separate from your main computer and its files. The final option is best if you are a power user or expert who wants to use the latest WSL features and build the skills with the platform as soon as possible. We'll go through all options here. Option 1: Install Linux Tools​ This is probably the easiest option and the one I would recommend for most user. It will let you run something like a Linux shell when you choose to, but not get in your way during day-to-day usage of your computer. To get a Linux-like experience on a Windows machine, we'll install Cygwin. Cygwin provides a large set of programs which are generally available on Linux systems, which are designed to work on Windows. Download the Cygwin installer and start the installation process. You should see something like this: Start the installation and tell it to install from the internet (the default option): Install for all users in the default location. It is also fine to change the options if you prefer: Cygwin will ask you where to install downloaded packages, whether a proxy is needed, and what download sites to use. Leave these options at their default unless you know what you are doing and why you'd need to change them. It will then start downloading. Once it has downloaded the list of available packages to install, it will ask which packages you want. Choose the default option \"All\": The installer will now start downloading and installing the programs: Once Cygwin has finished installing, you will have a link to open Cygwin available on the desktop and start menu. You can use this link to start using the \"Bash\" shell, or if you prefer you can open the \"Command Prompt\" as described in Opening the Shell and run the bash program: Note that you shouldn't use the --norc option. I have used it in the screenshot above just so that my Bash looks like it would after a clean install, without my own customisations added. At this point you have a ready-to-go bash environment and can continue on to the Summary and Next Section. Option 2: Use a Virtual Machine​ We can run a virtual machine on Windows which will give us a complete Linux environment. This is an ideal way to create a safe sandbox for experimentation, without changing how the rest of the system is setup. There are many ways to run a virtual machine on Windows. For this example we'll use the free 'Oracle VirtualBox' tool. VirtualBox will run a virtual machine, and on that virtual machine we will install the popular Ubuntu distribution of Linux. First, start downloading Ubuntu, which might take some time as the download is quite large. You will want to install the latest Desktop Edition (which at the time of writing is version 18): While the Ubuntu software downloads, we can install VirtualBox. Go to the VirtualBox Website and download the VirtualBox installer. You will need the installer for 'Windows Hosts'. Once the installer has downloaded, run it to start the installation: Next you will be asked to configure the installation options. The defaults will be fine for most users: Then the installation will start: Once the installation is complete and the Ubuntu installer has downloaded we can move onto the next step. Open VirtualBox and choose 'New' to create a new Virtual Machine. Ensure \"Expert Mode\" is selected. Provide a name for the machine and choose \"Linux\" as the type and \"Ubuntu_64\" as the version type. Everything else can be left as the default, unless you want to tweak the machine settings: You will be asked to setup a virtual hard disk. I would recommend the default options for most users: Once the machine has been created it will be shown in the main VirtualBox window. Select the machine and choose \"Start\": When the machine starts up it will ask you for a \"Startup Disk\". This is the disk which will be used to setup the operating system. Press the \"browse\" icon, then choose \"open\" and select the Ubuntu file which you downloaded, which should end in .iso: If this step fails, you may need to disable \"Hyper-V\" and \"Windows Sandbox\" by going to \"Add or Remove Windows features\": After a short while you will see the Ubuntu installer start up. Choose the \"Install Ubuntu\" option: You can specify language settings, what components are installed and more. These options can be left at the default. On the final page, choose the \"Erase disk and install Ubuntu\" option: The final step will be to choose a name for the computer, and a username and password to log in with. You can use any values you like here, just don't forget them! After this the installation will proceed. It might take a little while. After the installation is complete, you will need to restart. If you get an error saying \"Please remove installation medium\" just power off the machine and restart it. After restarting you can log into the machine with the credentials you specified earlier. When you have logged in, press the applications icon on the bottom-left of the screen and search for the \"Terminal\" application: You are now running the \"Bash\" shell in the terminal. You can run the whoami command to show the current user, or bash --version to see the version of Bash which is installed: That's it! You now have a virtual machine running Ubuntu and Bash which you can use to learn about the shell. Option 3: Setup the Windows Subsystem for Linux​ The Windows Subsystem for Linux is a relatively new set of features for Microsoft Windows. It allows users to install a Linux distribution on their Windows machine. This is a great way for us to be able to use the \"Bash\" shell without having to set up a virtual machine. First, open up the \"Turn Windows Features on or off\" option from the control panel: Then enable the \"Windows Subsystem for Linux\" feature: After your computer has restarted, open up the Windows App Store and search for \"Ubuntu\": Once Ubuntu has installed, open up the app. It will then initialise (which can take a little while): Choose a username and password to complete the setup: And that's it! You can now open the Ubuntu app at any time to use Ubuntu on Windows, interfacing using the Bash shell.","s":"Microsoft Windows","u":"/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/getting-started/","h":"#microsoft-windows-1","p":32},{"i":49,"t":"If you are running a Mac, then you can probably run the standard Terminal program and follow the material in this book without making any changes. However, the version of Bash which comes installed by default on MacOS is version 3, which is a little out of date. I would strongly suggest that you upgrade the default installation. On MacOS Catalina, the default shell has changed to Z Shell - this should work fine for all of the examples in this book, but you might want to switch it to Bash to be on the safe side (you can always change back later). To install the right software, we'll use a tool called Homebrew. Homebrew is a 'package manager', a tool used to install software on your computer, from the shell. It's kind of like the App Store but for shell users! First, follow the instructions online to install Homebrew: In most cases, this will require opening the Terminal program and running a snippet which looks like this: /usr/bin/ruby -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)\" However, this might have changed since the time of writing so do check the website to see what the latest instructions are. You don't actually need to know what is going on with this command (but by the time you've worked through a bit more of this book it will make sense!), but in a nutshell it runs a basic installation script, using the Ruby programming language (which comes pre-installed on MacOS). Once this has installed, install Bash by running the following command in the shell: brew install bash This uses the brew command, which we have just installed, to install the bash program. Finally, update the Terminal preferences to use the version of Bash you have just installed, rather than the default, by setting the shell location to /usr/local/bin/bash: Again, why we make these changes is not essential to know for now, we'll go into more details in a later section. Once you've made this change, whenever you open a new terminal window, it will run the latest version of Bash, which you can confirm by running echo $BASH_VERSION: There is actually a more sophisticated way to change what shell is used in a system, which is the special chsh command (short for \"change shell\"). We'll see this in a later section. We'll also see what echo is in more detail shortly.","s":"MacOS","u":"/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/getting-started/","h":"#macos-1","p":32},{"i":51,"t":"As before, if you are running Linux I will assume you are able to open a terminal and setup the appropriate shell.

We're not going to go into lots of detail, there's plenty of that later on in book. Instead we'll do a quick crash course on the basics. If you have not used the shell before this'll give you a chance to see how it works. Start by opening your shell. This is covered in Opening the Shell. Your shell should be Bash - if this doesn't sound familiar, then make sure you have followed the instructions in Configuring the Shell. You should see your terminal program running your shell. You can see what the version is of your shell by running: bash --version Let's quickly dissect this. We have run the bash command. A command can be a program on your computer, or it can be something built into the shell. We'll look at this in a lot more detail later, but for now it's important to understand that a lot of what you will be doing is running commands. The --version text is a parameter. Parameters affect how commands work. This is actually easier to see with an example. Let's move to the home folder. On most computers your home folder is your personal space where things like documents, photos, music, downloads and so on are kept. Let's switch to the home folder by running the following command: cd ~ Once you've done that, run the pwd command: pwd So what has happened here? The first command: cd ~ Is used to change directory - that's what cd stands for. The parameter we passed to cd was just the 'tilde' character (~). This character has a special meaning in the shell - it means \"the current user's home directory\". Finally, we ran the pwd command. This command is short for print working directory. It writes out to the screen where you currently are. On my Mac, my home directory is located at /Users/dwmkerr, which is what the command has shown me. Let's take another look at a command. Run the following in your shell: ls The ls command is short for list directory contents - it shows you everything that is in the current directory. On my computer you can see things like the 'Downloads', 'Music' and 'Pictures' folders, which are set up by default on a Mac, as well as some of my own folders. We can pass different parameters to ls. The main parameter is the location of the folder we'd like to list the contents of. So if we wanted to see what was in the Music folder, we'd just run: ls Music Not much to see here: Many commands actually allow us to pass multiple parameters. For example, we could list the contents of my Movies and my personal applications: ls Movies Applications There's not much in either. You might wonder why Applications is so empty - that's because we're looking at the applications only installed for the current user, because we are in the user's home directory. To see the applications for everyone we'd need to use the folder where applications are kept for all users. We can do this by running ls /Applications: The trick here is that we start with a leading forward slash - this means the Applications folder in the root of the computer, not the one in my current folder. On Windows, applications are kept in different places, but we can see some of the installed applications by running ls \"c:\\program files\\\": Why do we have the extra quotation marks here? If we ran the command without the quotation marks, the shell would think we were giving it two parameters. It would think we wanted to see the contents of the c:\\program and files folders - and they don't exist! The error above shows what happens when we miss the quotation marks. Now we can take a look at how a flag would work. A flag is a parameter which changes how a command works. Flags normally start with a hyphen. Let's say we wanted to know the size of the files in the folder. We do this by using the -lh pass the parameter, which is short for long list, human readable: ls -lh Downloads/*.jpg Now I can see all of the jpg files (jpg files are images) in my Downloads folder. I can see it looks like I've got two pictures of \"Mardi Himal\" (a mountain in the Himalayas) which are both 384 Kilobytes in size, as well as some other images. Blow by blow, this is what we've got: ls - List the contents of a folder -lh - This is the long list in human-readable sizes parameter, which means we see how big the files are in a friendly format (like 911K for Kilobytes, rather than showing something like 911012 which would be the number of bytes - and harder to read!) Downloads/*.jpg - Show the contents of the Downloads folder, including any files which end with .jpg - the * is a wildcard which means that we don't mind what the filename is The -lh parameter is shorthand. Many commands offer longhand parameters (such as --version) as well as shorthand (such as -v as an alternative for --version). Longhand is easier to read, shorthand is faster to type. Don't worry - in the next section we'll see how to look up the available parameters for a command. You don't need to remember all of these details, only understand which part is the command and which parts are the parameters. This is just an introduction for now! Now let's look at one more command.","s":"A Quick Demo of the Shell","u":"/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/getting-started/","h":"#a-quick-demo-of-the-shell","p":32},{"i":57,"t":"The 'echo' command is used to write out a message in the shell. Here's an example of how it works: echo \"Hello Shell!\" This command writes out the text Hello Shell!: Why would we do this? One of the most common reasons would be to see what the shell thinks a certain value is. For example, try this command: echo \"My home directory is at: $HOME\" You'll see something like this: The $HOME part of the text is called a variable. We can recognise variables because they start with a dollar symbol. $HOME is a built-in variable which holds the location of the current user's home directory. We're going to see all sorts of cool things we can do with echo as we continue in the book!","s":"The Echo Command","u":"/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/getting-started/","h":"#the-echo-command","p":32},{"i":59,"t":"One common thing we can do in a visual file explorer is move around. We can open folders, and go 'up' from the current folder. We often also see visually where we are in the folder structure with an 'address bar'. A useful reference might be the picture below: Here we map the shell commands to the visual interface's equivalents: pwd shows the current working directory - where you currently are in the file system ls lists the files in the current directory (or any directory you tell it) cd .. changes the directory to another location - if you use the special .. directory, you are telling it to change to the parent directory, i.e. 'go up' in the file system As a final trick, lets see how we open a file or folder. Let's say I want to open one of the photos in my Downloads folder. Here's how I can do it: cd ~/Downloadsopen himalayas.jpg We can see the result here: Running open himalayas.jpg has opened the photo in the application which is used for photos by default in the operating system. Be aware - this command is different on different operating systems (but we're going to see later on how to fix that and make it consistent everywhere!). The open command will open a file on MacOS. On Windows you can use start, and on Linux you can generally use xdg-open. As a nifty trick, trying running open .1: . This will open the current folder. Every folder contains two 'special' folders. The first is .., which we've seen means 'my parent folder' and the second is ., which means 'myself'. Having this . folder is convenient, as it means we can do things like this - run a command to open the current folder. We're going to go into a lot more detail on how to work with files and folders, move around, but hopefully this has provided a crash course for the basics. They key concepts to remember, which are much more important than the individual commands we've see are: In the shell we run commands We can change how commands work by using parameters Some parameters just go at the end of the command - like ls Downloads Some parameters start with a hyphen, and change how the command behaves - these are often called 'flags'. An example is ls -lh, which lists the files in the current folder with a human-readable file size We've also learned: cd changes the current directory pwd prints the current directory ls lists the files in a directory echo can be used to write out text to the screen open, start and xdg-open can be used to open a file or folder on MacOS, Windows and Linux respectively Now we can start to get into more detail!","s":"Move Around","u":"/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/getting-started/","h":"#move-around","p":32},{"i":61,"t":"In this section we learnt: That this book is for IT professionals, hobbyists or anyone who wants to learn more about how to work with computers What the shell is, and why we might want to use it How to open the shell programs for Windows, Mac and Linux which are installed by default How to configure the shells for Windows or Mac to behave in a Linux-like way to allow us to follow on with the rest of the book We introduced the following commands: cd - which changes directory pwd - which prints the current working directory ls - which lists the contents of a directory echo - which writes text to the screen open - which will open a file or folder We also briefly introduced variables, which are special values which start with the dollar symbol, such as $HOME which stores the user's home directory.

We don't want to test all of this on our own personal files until we know exactly what we're doing! To help with this, I've created a zipped up 'samples' which has a lot of files in it which we can use to play with. Now the file itself is available on the effective-shell.com website, right here: effective-shell.com/downloads/effective-shell-samples.zip We could open up a web browser, download the file, unzip it and then start from there, but this book is all about how to deal with every day tasks in your shell, so let's skip the browser and do it in the shell instead! Open your shell - if you've not yet got set up with your shell, that's OK, just check Chapter 1 - Getting Started. Now that you have your shell open, we can run the wget command (Web Get) to download the zip file. Let's download it to our Home folder. If you are not sure what the Home folder is, check Chapter 2- Navigating Your System. First, we'll move to our home directory, then download the file. cdwget https://effective-shell.com/downloads/effective-shell-samples.zip You'll see something like this: When you call the wget command, you can give it any web address and it'll download it to your current folder. It also shows the progress of the download interactively (particularly useful if it's a big file!). As an aside, if we were not in our home folder when we called the wget command, we'd download the file to wherever we are currently working in. If we wanted to be explicit about where we download the file, we can use the -O (Output File) flag to say explicitly where we want to download the file. As an example, if were not in the home folder, but wanted to download there, we'd just call: cdwget -O ~/playground.zip https://effective-shell.com/downloads/effective-shell-samples.zip Now that we've downloaded the file, let's look at our home directory now, with a quick call to ls ~: Cool - we have the zip file downloaded!

By the way - be really careful with the rm command. Unlike in a graphical interface, it won't put files you delete into a recycle bin, they are blatted forever! In a later chapter we'll see some ways to change this behaviour for your local machine, but always remember rm is a little risky! However one thing it will do to try and help you not make mistakes is let you know if you are trying to delete a folder, not a file. Run the following command to try and delete the unzipped folder: rm ~/effective-shell-samples The rm command has not succeeded in this case - it's warning us that we're not deleting a file, but a whole directory. Now we can get around this by adding the -r flag, which means 'recursive' - i.e. not just the folder but everything in it. But use this with caution!","s":"Deleting Files","u":"/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/managing-your-files/","h":"#deleting-files","p":62},{"i":73,"t":"Let's take a look at what is in the samples. By the way, the output you see on your computer might have a few more files in it as I might have added some after writing this article! In a graphical user interface, we'd open the folders and look at the files. In the shell, we can use the tree command to show the contents of a folder. Now the tree command is not installed by default on all systems. So if you are on a Mac, run: brew install tree If you are on Linux, you will likely already have it. If you don't, use your distributions package manager to get it (e.g. apt-get install -y tree). Using a non-universal command is generally not our goal in this book, but in these early stages while we are transitioning from the graphical user interface, the tree command can be really helpful. Later on we'll see how to use the more universal find command to give a similar output. Try it out with: tree ~/effective-shell-samples The tree command shows you all of the folders and files in a location. If we are unsure what one of the files is, we can ask the shell to give us more info. For example, I could find out more about the loas-gch.JPG file by running: file ~/effective-shell-samples/pictures/loas-gch.JPG Note that the file command is already showing it is a bit more clever.

Rename the copy we made of the photo by running: mv pictures/loas-gch-copy.JPG pictures/loas-gch-copy.jpeg Let's run tree to see what happened. Remember - now that our working folder is the playground, we don't even need to tell tree where to look, if we give it no arguments it'll assume we're looking at the working directory: Much nicer!

Run the commands: mkdir photostree And we should see: We've use the mkdir command, which is short for Make Directory. This is how we create a new folder in the shell. Now let's say we wanted to be really organised, and create a photos folder by year and topic, perhaps 2019/outdoors/pictures. In a graphical user interface, we'd have to create each folder one at a time. In the shell, it's easy! mkdir -p 2019/outdoors/picturestree Let's see how it looks: All we had to do was add the -p flag (which means \"make the parent folder if it doesn't already exist) and we can create a whole set of subfolders.

Well rmdir will remove a folder! rmdir photostree As an important sidenote, just how rm doesn't move files to your recycle bin, so you cannot undo the operation, rmdir works the same way. So if we try to remove a directory which has things in it, such as the pictures directory, it will fail: rmdir pictures In this case, it is actually easier to just call rm -r pictures. Why is that? Well it's just like we saw in the earlier example - rm can delete files or directories.

We're just showing the text in the terminal, not concatenating (i.e. joining) anything! Well the reason is that the cat command does concatenate files (i.e. puts them together), it's just that we only gave it one file, so it had nothing to join it to. By default, cat writes the output to the screen, so this is one of the most common ways you'll see to quickly look at the contents of a file. We'll see a lot more about how this works later, and how you can then take that output and put it somewhere else. But for now, let's finish with a couple of tricks. First, let's just cat the whole folder: cat quotes/* There we see the * wildcard again. We could be more specific and use something like cat quotes/*.txt to only show files ending in .txt. Notice how the output from all of the files has been concatenated together into a single output? That's where the cat name comes from - it concatenates, i.e. joins files. As one last trick, let's use this output but instead of showing it on the screen, put it into a single all-quotes.txt file: cat quotes/* > quotes/all-quotes.txttreecat quotes/all-quotes.txt The > part of this is called a redirect operator - in short it's telling the shell not to write to the screen, but to write to a file.

These manuals should contain all command line options and details of how to use the tool. You can scroll up and down through the content with the arrow keys.

There are lots of commands you can use to navigate through files with less, but the bare essentials are: d - Scroll down half a page u - Scroll up half a page j / k - Scroll down or up a line. You can also use the arrow keys for this q - Quit /<search> - Search for text n - When searching, find the next occurrence N - When searching, find the previous occurrence There are many other commands, but the set above is normally what I find myself using the most.

A few more details can be found with the man man command. You can put any text content into your pager - try this: ls -al /usr/bin | less This lists the contents of the /usr/bin folder, piping the output to less so we can easily scroll through it.

Take a look at man less: The number is the manual Section Number. The different sections of the manual are documented and can be found on most Unix-like systems in man's documentation, which you can check by running man man1. Here's what you'd get on Ubuntu 16: Section 1 - Executable programs or shell commands Section 2 - System calls (functions provided by the kernel) Section 3 - Library calls (functions within program libraries) Section 4 - Special files (usually found in /dev) Section 5 - File formats and conventions (e.g. /etc/passwd) Section 6 - Games Section 7 - Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7) Section 8 - System administration commands (usually only for root) Section 9 - Kernel routines (Non standard) Not all of these explanations will be entirely clear to everyone, so we'll go through the sections in detail shortly. If you want to, you can specifically choose which section of the manual you are looking in by using: man <section> <search> You can also get more information about the sections themselves by opening up the intro page. For example: $ man 1 introINTRO(1) BSD General Commands Manual INTRO(1)NAME intro -- introduction to general commands (tools and utilities)DESCRIPTION Section one of the manual contains most of the commands which comprise... Why would you do this, and why would you care? In general you won't need to worry about the sections unless you are looking for something which has an entry in multiple sections and you want to specify which one you use. Another reason it is useful to know about the sections is that a lot of documentation (online and offline) includes a section number after the name of a command or file. Knowing what the section is can be useful in this case. Here are a few examples of entries from each section, which illustrate what each section is for. Section 1: Programs and Shell Commands​ These are programs - probably what you are going to be looking up most regularly! For example, man 1 time shows: TIME(1) BSD General Commands Manual TIME(1)NAME time -- time command executionSYNOPSIS time [-lp] utilityDESCRIPTION The time utility executes and times utility. After the utility finishes, time writes the total time elapsed, the time consumed by system overhead, and the time used to execute utility to the standard error stream. Times are reported in seconds.... Section 2: System Calls​ You'll probably not use this section unless you are doing systems programming2. This section contains info on the available Linux Kernel system calls. For example, running man 2 chown gives: CHOWN(2) BSD System Calls Manual CHOWN(2)NAME chown, fchown, lchown, fchownat -- change owner and group of a fileSYNOPSIS #include <unistd.h> int chown(const char *path, uid_t owner, gid_t group);... This entry shows you how you would call the function if you were programming for the Kernel. Section 3: Library Calls​ These are the manpages for the C standard library functions. For example, man 3 time: TIME(3) BSD Library Functions Manual TIME(3)NAME time -- get time of dayLIBRARY Standard C Library (libc, -lc)SYNOPSIS #include <time.h> time_t time(time_t *tloc);... You would use this information if you were writing programs to run on the system. Here we can see why the sections are important to know about. There are multiple entries for time. We need to use the sections to differentiate between them. Running man time would not open the page above, because man searches the library in ascending section order, meaning that it actually finds time(1) and shows the pages for the time program, not the time C library call. Because of the potential ambiguity of names if no section number is included, in lots of Linux documentation you'll see the man section number written next to library calls, system calls, programs and so on (things will refer to sed(1) or time(3) for example. Section 4: Devices​ This section deals with the special devices which live in the /dev/* folder. For example, running man 4 random shows: RANDOM(4) BSD Kernel Interfaces Manual RANDOM(4)NAME random , urandom -- random data source devices.SYNOPSIS pseudo-device randomDESCRIPTION The random device produces uniformly distributed random byte values of potentially high quality.... Again, we see that section numbers can be important. If you just run man random, you'll see: RANDOM(3) BSD Library Functions Manual RANDOM(3)NAME initstate, random, setstate, srandom, srandomdev -- better random num- ber generator; routines for changing generatorsLIBRARY Standard C Library (libc, -lc)SYNOPSIS #include <stdlib.h> char * initstate(unsigned seed, char *state, size_t size); long random(void);... Which is the manpage for random(3), which is C library function, not the /dev/random file! We'll see more of these special files later in the book. Section 5: File Formats​ This section details special files in the system. For example, man 5 crontab shows: CRONTAB(5) BSD File Formats Manual CRONTAB(5)NAME crontab -- tables for driving cronDESCRIPTION A crontab file contains instructions to the cron(8) daemon of the gen- eral form: ``run this command at this time on this date''. Each user has their own crontab, and commands in any given crontab will be exe- cuted as the user who owns the crontab. Uucp and News will usually have their own crontabs, eliminating the need for explicitly running su(1) as part of a cron command.... Which describes the crontab file used to define scheduled tasks. Again, this is different to man crontab which would document crontab(1). Similarly, man 5 passwd is going to show something quite different to man passwd. You'll potentially use this section if you are performing system administration. Section 6: Games​ Nothing says it better than man 6 intro itself (this'll not work on a Mac sadly, but try it on another Linux system): ...DESCRIPTION Section 6 of the manual describes all the games and funny little programs available on the system.... There are probably a few silly programs available on your system, here you'll find their manuals. For example, man 6 banner on a Mac shows: BANNER(6) BSD Games Manual BANNER(6)NAME banner -- print large banner on printerSYNOPSIS banner [-d] [-t] [-w width] message ...DESCRIPTION Banner prints a large, high quality banner on the standard output. If the message is omitted, it prompts for and reads one line of its stan- dard input.... This section is going to be highly dependent on your operating system! Section 7: Miscellaneous​ This is where you'll find additional assorted documentation. For example, man 7 ascii shows: ASCII(7) BSD Miscellaneous Information Manual ASCII(7)NAME ascii -- octal, hexadecimal and decimal ASCII character setsDESCRIPTION The octal set: 000 nul 001 soh 002 stx 003 etx 004 eot 005 enq 006 ack 007 bel... Section 8: System Commands​ We've actually already seen one of these commands mentioned, in the manpage for crontab(5) it mentions cron(8). Let's see, with man 8 cron: CRON(8) BSD System Manager's Manual CRON(8)NAME cron -- daemon to execute scheduled commands (Vixie Cron)SYNOPSIS cron [-s] [-o] [-x debugflag[,...]] These are commands which system administrators would normally run. You might open section eight unexpectedly, for example man chmod will open chmod(1), but man chown will open chown(8), as it is a system command. Some distributions might vary for section nine. On my Mac it contains information about the kernel interfaces, a C style guide and some more. Getting the Index of Manual Section​ Manpages are just files on the filesystem, so you can get the index of a section just by looking in the appropriate folder. For example, to index the available system calls, try ls /usr/share/man/man2: EV_SET.2FD_CLR.2FD_COPY.2FD_ISSET.2FD_SET.2FD_ZERO.2_exit.2accept.2access.2acct.2... This is quick and easy way to see what sort of entries you have on your system. If you want to work out where an entry lives, use the -w flag: $ man -w printf/usr/share/man/man1/printf.1 There are other ways to show the index of each section, but they vary a lot from system to system so showing the actual files is probably easier. Searching the Manual​ You can search the manpage titles and summaries with man -k. For example, man -k cpu shows: cpuwalk.d(1m) - Measure which CPUs a process runs on. Uses DTracedispqlen.d(1m) - dispatcher queue length by CPU. Uses DTracegasm(n), grammar::me::cpu::gasm(n) - ME assembler You can find more advanced options for searching by using your newfound man skills on man itself. You can also use the apropos or whatis commands to search through the manuals. However, for simplicity I suggest just remember man -k!","s":"Manual Sections","u":"/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/getting-help/","h":"#manual-sections","p":94},{"i":109,"t":"In general for this book I'm trying to avoid suggesting too many non-standard tools which don't come pre-installed on systems.

Open your shell, and enter the following command: pwd You should see something like this: When we open a folder in a graphical user interface, we are always viewing the contents of a folder, or directory. When you open the shell, the same applies - we are always sitting in a specific directory. The pwd command is the Print Working Directory command. It shows the full path of the directory that you are in. There's one more way to find the working directory. It is stored in an Environment Variable called PWD. An environment variable is just a bit of data that you can access from your shell. You can create them, you can change them, and there are some which are set for you by the system or the shell to help you out. Try the following command: echo \"My current working directory is: $PWD\" You should see something like this: The dollar symbol is used to tell the shell we want to use the PWD variable, not write out the text PWD.

It will show the contents of a directory. If we don't give it any parameters, it will show the contents of the current directory. There are a lot of options for the ls command. For now, let's look at one of the most common options -l. This shows the contents as a list: ls -l A little like the 'details' view in a graphical user interface, this list view shows us more details, such as who owns the file or folder, when it was modified, and more.

These comments are just for readability, you don't need to include them. But if you are saving your own shell snippets (or \"scripts\"), then you might find comments a useful way to remind yourself of what you are hoping to achieve with the commands, or to make the script more readable. On my system, we'll see the following output: The cd command is the Change Directory command. You might see a pattern here - shell commands often are very short (to make it easier to type them quickly) and are often made up of the first letters of the description of the command (pwd for Print Working Directory, cd for Change Directory). Now that you know how the cd command works, you will be able to move around to different folders.

There are two types of paths - Absolute Paths and Relative Paths. An absolute path is one which gives the exact location of a file. For example, on my computer, the absolute path to the folder I am writing this book in is: /Users/dwmkerr/repos/github/dwmkerr/effective-shell Absolute paths always start with a slash. That's how the system knows it is an absolute path. The / is the root of the file system - basically it's the folder which everything else lives in. If I have an absolute path, I know exactly where the file or folder is. Let's compare this to a relative path. Below is the relative path in my shell for the file I'm writing right now: website/content/docs/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell This path is relative to my current working directory in the shell. This means that this path only makes sense if you use it from a specific directory. If I am in my Pictures folder, and I want to move to the 2020-photos folder, I could do it in two ways. The first is with an absolute path: cd /Users/dwmkerr/Pictures/2020-photos The second is with a relative path: cd 2020-photos In short - relative paths are often useful if you want to move to something within the current directory and absolute paths are useful if you need to move to somewhere completely different.","s":"Understanding Paths","u":"/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/navigating-your-system/","h":"#understanding-paths","p":114},{"i":125,"t":"As you experiment with these commands, you might have noticed that every folder contains two other folders, one with the name . and one with the name ... Run ls -al on the pictures folder to see an example: ls -al pictures You should see something like this: This picture highlights two special folders - . and ... These are special folders which exist in every folder in the system. The first folder, ., represents the folder it is in. Why would this be useful? Well, sometimes we just want a quick way to say the equivalent of \"right here\" in a command. For example, if I wanted to copy the current folder to a backup folder, I could do this: cp . /backup The cp command is the Copy command, and we'll see it in the next chapter. But the key thing to note is that we can use . to tell the command to copy the folder we are in right now. The .. folder means the parent folder. You can use this to \"go up\" to the parent folder, for example: cd ..ls . Would give: Note that we've used cd .. to change directory to the parent folder then ls to list the contents of the current folder. We could also just have used ls on its own as it defaults to the current folder. The .. folder can be helpful if you need to navigate to a location which is outside of your current folder. For example, if I am in the pictures folder and I want to move to the scripts folder, I can just use: cd ../scriptsls And we'll see this:","s":"The Special Dot and Dot Dot Folders","u":"/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/navigating-your-system/","h":"#the-special-dot-and-dot-dot-folders","p":114},{"i":127,"t":"There is one more special part of the file system we have to know about. That is the Home Directory. In Linux-like systems every user has their own personal directory where they can keep their files and folders. This directory can always be accessed through the ~ character. For example, no matter where I am in the system, I can run the following command to move to my home directory and show the contents: cd ~ls This would show something like this: This makes moving around your home directory very easy. For example, on a Mac, to go to your pictures folder from anywhere, you can always just run: cd ~/Pictures Your home directory on most computers will be where you keep your documents, pictures, videos and so on. Normally this directory is not accessible to other users of the system. Each user in a system gets their own home directory. You can also see the home directory by using the special HOME environment variable: echo \"My home directory is: $HOME\" This would show something like this: One useful trick - running cd without any parameters will always take you home!

The popd command 'pops' the working directory off the top of the stack. A stack is a structure often used in computers; we can actually push lots of different files to the working directory stack. Why is it called a stack? Well, the reason is that if we were to visualise the structure, it might look like a stack of plates or similar.

However, disassociating whether there is a general increase in the need for diverse technical skillsets and whether there is a specific increase in the popularity of keyboard and script operated systems is a challenge. For the purposes of this chapter, we'll instead examine changes in the technology landscape over the last few decades and consider what those changes might mean for the shell, the command-line and similar tools. We'll look at three specific developments in technology: Diversity of programming languages Convergence of operating platforms DevOps Each of these developments has a potentially profound impact on how we work with computers, and might hint at the long term need for shell skills.","s":"Is there a Renaissance of the Shell?","u":"/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/the-renaissance-of-the-shell/","h":"#is-there-a-renaissance-of-the-shell","p":134},{"i":139,"t":"So let's look at some of the key changes in the technology landscape over recent years and consider how they might affect the popularity and importance of the shell.","s":"The Changing Technology Landscape","u":"/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/the-renaissance-of-the-shell/","h":"#the-changing-technology-landscape","p":134},{"i":141,"t":"There have been many programming languages and platforms over the years. But in recent years it is possible that the diversity has increased at a greater rate than ever before. With the advent of the internet and the increase in the size of the online technical community, programming has in a sense become more democratised (which we will discuss a little more in the 'citizen coder' section). When in the past it was necessary to find physical books or teachers and tutors to learn a programming language, students can now find a wealth of resources online. It is perhaps this democratisation which has led to a startlingly diverse world of programming languages. For many years, there were a small number of 'general purpose' languages, and a larger number of highly specialised languages (and associated platforms). \"C\", and later, \"C++\" were the go-to languages for systems programming (sometimes backed up by assembly language). This was the language which kernels and compilers were written in. Alongside these giants were the workhorses for specific use cases. Erlang was (and is) a language which is highly popular in the telecommunications industry, where high availability and reliability were paramount. COBOL was the language for the financial industry, where mission critical systems ran on mainframes (and many still do). Of course there were many other languages, but many of these other languages were highly specific, in a sense C, Java, PHP and later C# dominated the landscape. Transition to the time of writing. In the Stack Overflow 2020 Technology Survey1, the top ten languages most wanted by employers are: Python JavaScript Go TypeScript Rust Kotlin Java C++ SQL C# Some of our old friends are there, but there are many new languages, languages which are evolving quickly. Later on in the list we will see Swift, Dart, Ruby, Haskell, Scala. There are many programming languages which are extremely popular today. Why does this matter for the shell? The answer is that for many new languages, developer tooling is not as mature (some might say bloated) as it is for the 'Workhorse' languages. Java developers are likely very familiar with the Eclipse IDE, Microsoft shops will be familiar with Visual Studio. These are products which have been evolving for years (or decades) to support developers with rich integrated development environments. For server-side JavaScript, Golang, Rust, Python and other languages, the development environment really is the shell. Modern editors like Visual Studio Code, Atom and so on provide a vast amount of support and tooling, encompassing the features of a full fledged IDE if the user wants. But for modern programming languages, users often have had to rely on the shell to compile, transpile, manage packages, bundle and so on. The average developer today is perhaps much more likely to have to use the shell - to manage Python virtual environments one day, to run Node.js another, to install packages for Golang another. In time tooling will likely catch up and provide a 'friendly' interface on top of these operations, but many engineers have realised (or always known) that direct access to simple command line tools can be extremely efficient when working, and that overly featured IDEs can get in the way and hide complexity. The modern programming is often polyglot - having to be at least familiar in a number of languages. The shell provides a common environment and interface for tooling, which is accessible by all, without installing many complex components, for both development and runtime environments.","s":"The Diversity of Programming Languages","u":"/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/the-renaissance-of-the-shell/","h":"#the-diversity-of-programming-languages","p":134},{"i":143,"t":"Whilst the variety in programming languages and developer tooling may have increased, in many ways the operating platforms engineers use have become more homogeneous. In the early days of computing, each operating environment was highly diverse. There were many systems which were used for production and many of them were highly proprietary. Even popular application servers were often closed source and highly specialised. The modern execution environment however is often fairly uniform. A Linux-like system, with few customisations, which the developer or operator can tweak to suit their needs. More and more enterprise users have moved away from proprietary Unix platforms to Linux platforms (whether commercial or non-commercial). The earliest cloud environments were using open-source Linux distributions as the available operating systems. Even Windows has increasing support for Linux-like operation, in the form of the Windows Subsystem for Linux. Perhaps the greatest movement in this area has been the rapid adoption of Docker as a common container technology. Containers, or container-like systems have been around for a long time, but Docker brought containers to the masses. With Docker, engineers expect operating environments to be even more uniform and Linux-like. This has made knowledge of the shell extremely valuable. For any containerised workloads, Linux and shell skills are crucial. Kubernetes (as an execution environment) has standardised things even more. Whilst there are still many workloads which run on proprietary systems, modern solutions are often built to run in containers on Linux. The shell has historically been the most common way to manage Linux systems, and the standardisation of operating environments around Linux, or Linux-like systems has made shell skills even more critical.","s":"Convergence of Operating Platforms","u":"/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/the-renaissance-of-the-shell/","h":"#convergence-of-operating-platforms","p":134},{"i":145,"t":"Love it or hate it, DevOps has exploded in popularity. DevOps engineers, site-reliability engineers, these kinds of roles may have been unheard of in companies not that long ago and are now becoming ubiquitous. In attempting to unify the goals of development and operation of software, DevOps represents an organisational and cultural change. Rather than having one group focus on feature development and another group focus on reliable software operations, a single group is responsible for both. The theory is that this encourages software engineers to also consider security, reliability, maintainability etc, and operators to also consider speed of delivery. Regardless of whether teams are genuinely combined, or specialised roles are added to teams, or even if teams are still separated, the lines between development and operations blur somewhat. Software developers are expected to build and plan with knowledge of the execution environment, operators are expected to work with developers to build features which support reliability. The intersection of these two roles often is in the realm of automation. Automated deployments after testing, automated failover in case of errors, automated alerting when potential issues are discovered, automated provisioning of environments, automated scaling of systems when load increases. The world of automation is intimately linked to the world of the shell and in particular shell scripting. Many tasks which require automation can be easily achieved using shell scripts. Many aspects of modern environments (such as cloud environments) support provisioning and management of services via scripting. In fact, services which cannot be managed via shell scripts or simple interfaces are increasingly becoming obsolete. If it cannot be scripted, it cannot be automated, and the increasingly complex systems we build require automation. In practice, this means software engineers are far more likely to have to build shell scripts (or at least understand how to interface with systems via the shell) than they perhaps might have been. Similarly, operators are far more likely to have to program automated routines to manage high availability and so on. Again, the shell and shell scripts are a common way to manage this (even if they are simply entrypoints to more complex systems, such as scripts which execute programs). The rise in popularity of DevOps as a set of practices and beliefs has perhaps made the shell more popular, and more important, than any other recent developments in software engineering. And for these reasons and many more, learning how to use the shell effectively has never been more relevant or practical. https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020↩","s":"DevOps","u":"/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/the-renaissance-of-the-shell/","h":"#devops","p":134},{"i":147,"t":"On this page","s":"Finding Files","u":"/part-2-core-skills/finding-files","h":"","p":146},{"i":149,"t":"The find (search for files) command is used to search for files and folders and to perform operations on the results. Let's see it in action by running it in the ~/effective-shell folder.

Find not working on MacOS If you are running these samples on MacOS, you will probably see the following output: $ findusage: find [-H | -L | -P] [-EXdsx] [-f path] path ... [expression] This is the find command telling you what parameters can be used. On MacOS the default find command does not assume the current working directory. This is because there is a difference between the MacOS and GNU versions of find and in this book I will use GNU wherever possible as it will be more compatible (MacOS is based on the BSD operating system, most Linux distributions use a set of tools which are part of the GNU project - there are sometimes differences). To run the equivalent command on MacOS, just provide the current directory as a parameter: $ find . A better solution is to install the findtools package, which will install the GNU versions of the tools we'll be using: $ brew install findtools$ gfind If you do install findtools, remember that all of the GNU versions of the tools start with g - so when reading this chapter substitute find with gfind. For more details on what BSD and GNU are, you can check Chapter - Unix, Linux, GNU and POSIX, which covers these concepts in detail. So this is the find command - you can provide it a directory (or let it use the current directory) and the command will list all of files and folders in the given directory, including all children. You can also provide multiple directories: $ find /usr/bin /usr/sbin/usr/bin/usr/bin/fwupdtool/usr/bin/gnome-keyring.../usr/sbin/usr/sbin/cupsd/usr/sbin/pppdump...

This is because for the files in the apm-logs folder they don't have apm-logs in their name anywhere - that is in their path, i.e. the full address of the file including its folder. So let's look at how to search by path next! An Important Note on Quotes Make sure you use quotes when building your patterns. This command: $ find . -name \"*log*\" Will give different output to this command: $ find . -name *log* Why is this? In the first case, we explicitly pass the text *log* to the find command and let it deal with it. It uses the wildcards to build a pattern. Because we've surrounded the parameter with quotes, the shell itself doesn't try to do anything clever with the wildcard. In the second case, the shell itself tries to deal with the wildcards, then passes the results to find. And the shell deals with them differently. You can see exactly what the shell expands them to with this snippet: $ parameter=(*log*)$ echo $parameterlogs In the second case the shell is performing its own expansion of the wildcard and not searching through all of the child directories. We need to wrap the parameter with quotes so that the shell knows not to interfere with the text and instead pass it to find, so that find can deal with the wildcard. The shell is using globbing in the second case, which is covered in a later chapter.","s":"Searching by Name","u":"/part-2-core-skills/finding-files","h":"#searching-by-name","p":146},{"i":157,"t":"The -path parameter can be used to filter the results based on a pattern in the path of the file: $ find . -path \"*apm-logs*\"./logs/apm-logs./logs/apm-logs/apm05.logs./logs/apm-logs/apm02.logs./logs/apm-logs/apm03.logs./logs/apm-logs/apm00.logs./logs/apm-logs/apm01.logs./logs/apm-logs/apm04.logs Again, note that this is very specific, we've added wildcards to the pattern, making it *apm-logs*.

Also, why is it that I cannot type this: find -name \"something.txt\" /home/ But instead have to put the folder name before the parameters, which again is non-standard? The reason is actually quite simple - most of what we've seen so far are not parameters in the normal sense, they're just elements of a search expression. The structure of the find command is as follows: find <options> [starting point...] [expression] The options (or parameters) for the find command are short, one-letter options which go before the file name. The -L (follow links) option is an example - it goes before the starting point of the search: find -L /usr/bin -name \"*sh\" All of the other things we've seen so far which we've described as parameters are actually used to build the expression - the actual search pattern. The -name, -and, -or, -ipath and similar constructs we've looked at are actually part of a mini 'search language', they're not parameters to the command. This might seem obvious, or it might seem silly, but either way, remembering that the structure of the find command is find <options> [starting points...] [expression] may help you remember what order to write each part of the command in. It certainly took a few years for me to realise this was the reason, and until that point I used to get frustrated with find as I could never seem to remember how to use it properly!

It might be to delete, copy, edit, move or whatever. The find command can perform operations on the files which are found. Now before we continue, I'll warn that I'm not going to go into much detail here. The reason is that I actually recommend not using these operations. Instead, use the xargs command which is covered in Chapter 14 - Build Commands on the Fly with Xargs. The Xargs command lets you take the list of files from find and create any command you can think of. I think this is far more sensible than trying to learn all of the options for find - and it is closer to the Unix Philosophy of having the find command 'do one thing and do it well'. However, you'll see these operations in other books and articles, or perhaps in scripts you have to work with, so let's take a quick look at some of the common operations and how they are used.

This command does not show what has been deleted and does not ask for confirmation. It also slightly changes the order of results processed so that the children of folders are deleted where necessary before the folders themselves. This might not be what you expect because that's not what the -print output would show (although you can force this behaviour with the -depth option). Check Chapter 14 for a better solution - in short we can use find ~ -name \"*.tmp\" -print0 | xargs -p -0 rm to instead pass the files to rm and ask the user to confirm before the deletion happens.

Then we use wc -w {} to say \"call the wc (word count) command with the -w (words) flag. The {} text is expanded to the list of files. Finally, we need a semi-colon to tell find where the end of the exec command is. And because the semi-colon has a special meaning in the shell, we have to escape this semi-colon by putting a \\ backslash before it. The -exec action is very powerful - we can construct almost any arbitrary command with it, which can be really useful.

Running ls /bin will probably show that you have quite a few files. If you are on MacOS instead try running find /tmp to show the same oddity - the find program doesn't seem to show the contents of the files. So why did find /bin not show the files in the /bin folder? The answer is that /bin is a symlink (or if you are on MacOS and want to test the same behaviour and are using /tmp, /tmp is a symlink). You can see this by running the command below: $ ls -l / /usr | grep binlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 Aug 7 18:06 bin -> usr/binlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 8 Aug 7 18:06 sbin -> usr/sbindrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 40960 Jan 25 17:17 bindrwxr-xr-x 2 root root 20480 Jan 25 16:42 sbin Note how the root bin and sbin folders are actually just symlinks to usr/bin and usr/sbin respectively.

To go into detail on all of the options or potential ways these options can be combined to create operations could fill an entire book! My recommendation is to ensure that you know at least the basics we've shown so far.

Find large files The -size test can be used to search by file size - note how with a + and - we can set the minimum and maximum sizes: find / -size +1G -500G Find recently edited files The -mtime test can be used to find files which were recently modified: find . -not -path \"*/\\.*\" -mtime -2 Note how a -not -path test is used to skip anything which starts with a . dot (i.e files and folders which are normally considered hidden). Find files which have had permissions changed The -ctime test can be used to find files which have had their attributes (such as permissions) changed: find ~/.ssh -ctime -30 Find any executable scripts and make them non-executable We can search by permissions, as shown below: find ~ -perm /a=x -exec chmod -x {} + This example uses the -perm test, checking if 'all' (users, the owner and group) have the x (executable) bit set, then executes the chmod -x command to remove the executable bit. We also end the command with + rather than ;, which means we will execute chmod once with each file passed to the command (rather than running chmod for each file). Note that the + operator can cause an error if the list of files is too big for the command you pass it to to handle! Find empty folders and remove them with a confirmation We can use the -empty test to find empty folders: find ~ -type d -maxdepth 3 -empty -ok rmdir {} \\; This example uses the -empty test, as well as the -maxdepth parameter to limit the search to only three folders deep.

This is one of those tricks that when you know it, you'll wonder how you lived without it! Use Ctrl + x , Ctrl + e to edit-in place, opening the current command line in your default editor: Now it's important to explain that this is the shell's default editor. This might not be the same as the default editor for your operating system. You can see what the shell is using as its default editor by printing the contents of the EDITOR environment variable. For example, my shell will show this: $ echo $EDITORvim This means vim will be used to edit the command line. Your shell might use emacs or nano as a default editor. Unless you are familiar with vim or emacs, you might not find them particularly user friendly as an editor. You can change your default editor by setting the EDITOR variable. For example, below I set the editor to code (with the -w flag which tells the code program not to return control immediately back to the shell but instead wait until I've finished editing the file): Now this works (just about), but I wouldn't recommend using a Graphical Editor like Visual Studio Code for this. The reason is that because the editor runs in a separate window, it is actually easy to lose track of it (or the shell). You pause to take a short break, come back, close the editor and the contents are either lost or written to the shell (and if you see in the example above, the shell actually executed the command, rather than just putting it in the command line ready for me to execute). The other reason to avoid a graphical editor is that if you are using a shell on another user's machine, the editor might not be present (or might be configured differently). In general however, the main reason to avoid a graphical editor is that it moves the context of the command away from where you are in the shell to another place, which can be confusing. If you see the screenshot below, I have two editors open: The top right pane has my git commit command running (which is asking me to write a description of my changes) and the bottom right pane has the command line editor running (where I am testing out the commands for this chapter). In this example, each editor has taken the place of the contents of the shell, so there's no ambiguity about which command I am editing. If I was to open a graphical editor, it would open multiple tabs for this operation and I'd have to track which tab was which. It can be daunting to learn an editor like vim or emacs. Chapter 27 goes into more detail on the terminal based text editors - for now if you are not familiar with these programs I recommend you use the nano editor.

This configuration file can be used to configure things like the shortcuts used to move around. All of these shortcuts should be familiar to Emacs users.

We need a web server to serve styles and code. A super-useful one-liner to run a web server on any machine with Python installed is: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000 In fact, this is so useful that I normally alias this command, so that I can just type serve. We'll see aliases in a later chapter. Make sure you have the samples folder downloaded. Downloading the Samples Run the following command in your shell to download the samples: curl effective.sh | sh Now run the following commands to open the webpage: $ cd ~/effective-shell/websites/simple$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000 For now, if we run this command, then we can open the webpage in a browser, with the styles and code loaded: We can also see that the server has served the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files, this is clear from the output of the Python command we ran: $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 3000 ...127.0.0.1 - - [08/Jan/2021 16:33:40] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 200 -127.0.0.1 - - [08/Jan/2021 16:33:40] \"GET /styles.css HTTP/1.1\" 200 -127.0.0.1 - - [08/Jan/2021 16:33:40] \"GET /code.js HTTP/1.1\" 200 -127.0.0.1 - - [08/Jan/2021 16:33:40] code 404, message File not found127.0.0.1 - - [08/Jan/2021 16:33:40] \"GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1\" 404 - All well and good so far.

We have a problem. The python process is still running - it's serving the website. Our shell is essentially useless, until we stop the server. See what happens when I try to edit a file: In the example above, I try to run vi, but nothing is happening. Standard input is not being read by the server and not being interpreted by the shell. I have to kill the server by hitting Ctrl+C. This sends a SIGINT signal (which tells the command to stop). We saw signals briefly in Chapter 4 - Becoming a Clipboard Gymnast and we'll see more of them in as we continue. Now I need to clear my screen to get rid of all of the error messages, then start again. This is obviously not optimal.

By ending the command with an & ampersand symbol, we instruct the shell to run the command as a background job. This means that our shell is still functional. The shell has also notified us that this command is running as a background job with a specific job number: $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000 &[1] 19372 In slightly obtuse language, the shell has informed us that it has started a job in the background, with job number 1 and that this job is currently handling the process with ID 19372. The ampersand solution is a fairly common pattern used in day-to-day work. The process is in the background and our shell is available for us to use as normal, the web server will continue to run in the background.","s":"Solution 1: Start the Server in the Background","u":"/part-2-core-skills/job-control","h":"#solution-1-start-the-server-in-the-background","p":222},{"i":231,"t":"Let's say you forgot to start the command in the background.

Hitting Ctrl+Z sends a 'suspend' signal to the process2, pausing it and moving it to the background. Let's dissect this: $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 3000 ...127.0.0.1 - - [03/Jun/2019 13:38:45] \"GET / HTTP/1.1\" 200 -^Z[1] + 21268 suspended python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000 The shell echos as I type, so we see ^Z (i.e., the Ctrl+Z chord I entered). The shell responds by moving the process into a background job and suspending it. The key here is that it is suspended. The process is paused. So the web server is no longer serving. If you are following with the sample, reload your browser. The webpage fails to load, as the server process is not able to respond to requests. To continue the job, in the background, we use the bg ('background') command, with a job identifier (which always starts with a % symbol - we'll see why soon) to tell the shell to continue the job: $ bg %1[1] + 21268 continued python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000 The shell lets us know the job is being continued, and if we load the webpage again, the content is shown as expected. As a final check, we run the jobs command to see what jobs the shell is running: $ jobs[1] + running python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000 And there you have it - our server is running as a background job. This is exactly what we would see if we run jobs after starting the server with an & at the end. In fact, using an & is perhaps an easier way to remember how to continue a suspended job: $ %1 &[1] + 21268 continued python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000 In the same way ending a command with & runs it in the background, ending a job identifier with & continues it in the background.

The kill command I have used is not a special job control command (like bg or fg). It is the normal kill command, which terminates a process.

They are not intuitive to interface with and they suffer from some challenges. The most obvious one is that all jobs write to the same output, meaning you can quickly get garbled output like this: This is what happens when I run a job, which just outputs text every second. It's in the background, but it's printing all over my commands. Even running the jobs command to try and find the job to stop it is difficult. Input is even more complex. If a job is running in the background, but requires input, it will be silently suspended. This can cause confusion. Jobs can be used in scripts but must be done so with caution and could easily confuse a consumer of the script if they leave background jobs hanging around, which cannot be easily cleaned up6. Handling errors and exit codes for jobs can be problematic, causing confusion, poor error handling, or overly complex code. If jobs should be avoided, why discuss them at all? Well sometimes you move things into the background by mistake, sometimes it can be useful to quickly shift a download or slow command into the background, and also if you are going to avoid something it's good to know why! And the challenge of managing multiple units of work on a computer has been around for a long, long time, with jobs as one of the tools in the toolkit to deal with the challenge. But given I'd suggest to avoid jobs, let's summarise with the most key takeaways and some alternatives.","s":"Why You Shouldn't Use Jobs","u":"/part-2-core-skills/job-control","h":"#why-you-shouldnt-use-jobs","p":222},{"i":239,"t":"If there are two things to take away, they would be: If you have started running a command in the foreground, and you don't want to stop it and would rather move it to the background, hit Ctrl+Z.

Repeat as needed! In either case, if you need to do something more subtle, you can return to this reference. But the first command should allow you to get your shell back while you work out how to continue the job, and the second should kill a background job that is messing with your screen.","s":"The Most Key Takeaways","u":"/part-2-core-skills/job-control","h":"#the-most-key-takeaways","p":222},{"i":241,"t":"If you are using any kind of modern terminal such as iTerm, Terminal or the GNOME Terminal, just open a new tab or split! Much easier. The benefit to this is that each tab gets its own standard input and output, so there's no risk of overwriting. And of course you can hide/reveal/rearrange the tabs however you like. The traditional alternative to a job for an operator who simply wants more than one thing going on at once would be a terminal multiplexer, such as screen or tmux: Multiplexers work in a very similar way to a modern graphical terminal - they manage many shell instances. But there are some differences. Modern terminals, such as iTerm, tend to have more intuitive GUIs and a lot of features. Multiplexers can be stateful - and manage work even when you close the shell (allowing you to 're-attach' later. We can also run them over SSH sessions to manage complex operations on remote machines. They run a client-server model, meaning many people can work with many multiplexed processes (and they can persist beyond sessions). My personal preference is both - I use a modern terminal and run everything inside it in tmux, which is a very common multiplexer (and in some ways the spiritual successor to screen, an older multiplexer). We'll look at both of these options in later chapters.","s":"Alternatives to Jobs","u":"/part-2-core-skills/job-control","h":"#alternatives-to-jobs","p":222},{"i":243,"t":"You might find that jobs are useful, or you might find that they are not.

If you want to find out more about the gory details of jobs, the best place to start is the Bash Manual - Job Control Section, or the 'Job Control' section of your preferred shell's manual. On Bash you can find this by using man bash and searching for the text JOB CONTROL. You can find out more about how to get help in Chapter 5 - Getting Help If you are not a heavy shell user, this might seem unlikely. But if you do a lot of work in shells, such as sysadmin, devops, or do your coding from a terminal, this happens all the time!↩ Technically, SIGTSTP signal - which is 'TTY stop'. If you have always wondered about the 'TTY' acronym, check the chapter, Interlude: Understanding the Shell.↩ The alternative method is to use Ctrl+Y, which will send a delayed interrupt, which will continue to run the process until it tries to read from stdin. At this point, the job is suspended and the control given to the shell. The operator can then use bg or kill or fg to either move to the background, stop the process, or keep in the foreground as preferred. See: https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Job-Control↩ Another super-useful snippet: lsof -i -P -n | grep 8000 to find any process that has a given port open. Another one for the aliases chapter!↩ There are times this is needed. If a job runs many processes - for example, by running a pipeline - the process identifier will change as the command moves from one stage of the pipeline to the next. The job identifier will remain constant. Remember, a job is a shell command, so could run many processes.↩ To see how bad this can be, create a script that starts jobs, then run it. Then run the jobs command to see what is running.

As a more concrete example, we can look at the sort program - which sorts the input in alphabetic order: We can easily see this in action by just running sort in a shell. Start the sort program, enter some text, then press Ctrl+D. Ctrl+D (which is normally written as ^D is a special control character which means 'end of transmission' - in this case we use it to tell sort we've finished writing text. If you were to use ^C (which is the interrupt command) it would closes the sort program instead). $ sortDogschasecatsandcatschasemice Once you've entered the text you want to sort, hit ^D and you'll see the sorted output: Dogsandcatscatschasechasemice So by default, the sort command is reading input from the keyboard (until we send it a special message saying we're done), then writing the output to the terminal.

Well the reason is that while this is convention, it is not adhered to universally. Anyone who writes a program is free to choose how they read input and write output, so some programs might not follow these conventions. In Chapter 29 we'll look at how to write tools which follow these conventions, as well as others which are useful. Each of these files has a special number which is shown in grey in the diagram. This is known as the file descriptor and we'll see it later on. Each of these files also has a special location in the system which you can access directly - you can see these files by running ls -al /dev/std*: $ ls -al /dev/std*lr-xr-xr-x 1 root wheel 0 Jan 1 1970 /dev/stderr -> fd/2lr-xr-xr-x 1 root wheel 0 Jan 1 1970 /dev/stdin -> fd/0lr-xr-xr-x 1 root wheel 0 Jan 1 1970 /dev/stdout -> fd/1 If you are not familiar with ls (the list directory contents command) then check Chapter 2 - Navigating Your System. The first part of the output isn't too important - but we can see we have three files in the special /dev/ (short for device folder). We can also see the associated file descriptors. As an aside - this is a really fundamental thing we'll see again and again in Unix and Linux - almost everything can be represented as a file. This is a core concept and one we'll touch on regularly. When you are running programs in a shell, the shell attaches your keyboard to the program's standard input1, and attaches the standard output and standard error to the terminal display: This means when we're in a shell, we can type on the keyboard, which goes to the input of the program and then as the program outputs information and errors they show up on the screen. We can already see the beginnings of a pipeline here. There's a clear flow of data from the keyboard, through the stdin file, through the program, then through the output files, then to the display. Looking at some real programs in action will hopefully make this clearer!","s":"Standard Input, Output and Error","u":"/part-2-core-skills/thinking-in-pipelines/","h":"#standard-input-output-and-error","p":244},{"i":251,"t":"Do you remember the cat command?

This means we can now visualise the entire pipeline and see exactly what is going on: That's it! If you can follow what is going on here then you have the key information you need to know to understand how pipelines work. The pipe operator just connects the output of one program to the input of another. A pipeline is just a set of connected programs. Easy! We could do the same thing by writing the output of each step as a file, then reading that file with the next step, but that would mean we'd have a lot of intermediate files to clean up (and if we're processing a big file, it also uses a lot of space). Pipelines let us create complex sequences of operations which work well even on very large files. Now we'll look at stdin, stdout and stderr in a little more detail. We'll be seeing these special streams a lot as we go through the book. Knowing more about them is really going to help you when working in the shell or with Linux-like systems.","s":"A Pipeline in Action","u":"/part-2-core-skills/thinking-in-pipelines/","h":"#a-pipeline-in-action","p":244},{"i":253,"t":"Let's have a quick look at some of the common things we might see as sources of inputs for other programs. Each one illustrates an interesting point about how the shell or the standard input stream works. This list is by no means exhaustive, in fact with a bit of tinkering you can make almost anything the input to anything else, but let's check each example. These examples will use some new programs to transform the output - don't worry about the details of them, each will be described as we go through the book! The Shell You might just use code in the shell as input, for example: $ echo \"I am in the $PWD folder\" | sed 's/folder/directory/'I am in the /Users/dwmkerr/repos/github/dwmkerr/effective-shell directory Here we've just used echo to write out message including a variable and then used the sed (stream editor) program to replace the word folder with directory. We'll get a lot of practice with sed as we go through this book! Files We've already seen a few examples of using cat to write a file to stdout. A lot of the time we don't need to use cat many programs accept the path of a file as a parameter, meaning we can just tell the program to open the file directly. For example, we could count the number of lines in a file like this: $ cat ~/effective-shell/text/simpsons-characters.txt | wc -l 14 Or more simply, like this: $ wc -l ~/effective-shell/text/simpsons-characters.txt 14 /Users/dwmkerr/effective-shell/text/simpsons-characters.txt In this case, we've passed the file path as an argument to the wc (word, line, character and byte count) program. But be aware - not all programs use the same convention or parameter names! Now here's a cool trick. Type rev < /dev/stdin, then enter some text and hit ^D or ^C when done. You should see something like this: $ rev < /dev/stdinRed RummuR deR What's going on here? Remember we mentioned that stdin is a special stream which represents input and that it lives at /dev/stdin? This little trick uses redirection to redirect the stdin file to the rev (reverse) command. The < operator redirects the standard input of a program to come from the given file. We could also have written cat /dev/stdin | rev. Or just enter rev and type in the input we want to reverse! The Clipboard In Chapter 4 - Becoming a Clipboard Gymnast we saw a trick to remove formatting from text in the clipboard. Here's a similar trick to reverse the contents of the clipboard: $ pbpaste | rev | pbcopy This pipeline pastes the contents of the clipboard to stdout, which is piped to rev (reversing the text) and then pipes the output to pbcopy, which copies the results to the clipboard2. Filtered Input This is a trick a friend shared with me. He works with data scientists and whenever he shows them this command they love it! $ head -n 100 100GBFile.csv > 100linefile.csv The head (display first lines of a file) command in this case just grabs the first 100 lines of a file and puts it straight into a smaller, more manageable file. We'll see what the > symbol (the redirection symbol) means in the section lower down on Standard Output. You can also use tail in the same way to get the last lines from a file. And if you are a more advanced user, you might use something like this: $ grep -C 5 error /var/log/mylogfile.txt | less We'll see all of these commands as we go through the book, but this very cool trick uses the grep (file pattern searcher) command to search for the text error in the file /var/log/mylogfile.txt, shows five lines of context (-C 5), which are the lines before and after the match, then puts the result into your pager! We'll see the pager just below. We'll do a lot of grep-ing as we go through the book so don't worry if this looks a little confusing for now. Many More! We've only scratched the surface - almost any program will write to the standard output, meaning it can be the input for any pipeline you can imagine!","s":"Common Patterns - Standard Input","u":"/part-2-core-skills/thinking-in-pipelines/","h":"#common-patterns---standard-input","p":244},{"i":255,"t":"Now let's look at some of the things we can do with the standard output: Some of these outputs are things we've seen before, but let's do a quick revision. Display This is what we've been doing a lot of so far. When you are working with the shell interactively this makes a lot of sense. If you have jobs which run in the background (or on a timer, such as backup jobs which run nightly), you might not actually have a terminal attached to the program to see the output, in which case you'll likely write to a file. What about if you have a lot of output? It can be quite inconvenient to have to scroll through the terminal (or impossible, depending on the system you are on). In this case use a pager. A pager is a program which makes it possible to interactively page through output in the shell, scrolling up and down, searching and so on. Try this out as an example: ls /usr/bin /usr/local/bin /usr/sbin | less You'll see something like this: This long list of files would be hard to search through if it was printed directly to the shell, but in the pager we can use the d and u keys to go down and up, or the / and ? keys to search forwards or backwards. Piping into your pager is a really useful trick - you can read more about pagers in Chapter 5 - Getting Help. File The shell has a built in operator which will pipe the standard output of a program and write it to a file. It is the > or redirection operator: $ echo \"Here's some data\" > some_file.txt It's as easy as that! Note that this will overwrite anything already in the file. Append What if you don't want to overwrite a file, but instead just add a new line? The >> or append redirection operator: $ echo \"Tuesday was good\" >> diary.txt$ echo \"Wednesday was better!\" >> diary.txt$ echo \"Thursday suuucks\" >> diary.txt$ cat diary.txtTuesday was goodWednesday was better!Thursday suuucks This example writes each line in turn to the diary.txt file, appending the text to the end of the file (and creating it if it doesn't already exist). Appending to a file is extremely useful for circumstances where you might want to build or update a log of events over time. Pipe This is what we've spent most of this chapter looking at - to simply pipe the standard output to the standard input of another program! In this case, the output of our program becomes the input of the next one in the pipeline.","s":"Common Patterns - Standard Output","u":"/part-2-core-skills/thinking-in-pipelines/","h":"#common-patterns---standard-output","p":244},{"i":257,"t":"We haven't actually seen stderr in action yet. Let's see how it works. $ mkdir ~/effective-shell/new-folder$ mkdir ~/effective-shell/new-foldermkdir: /home/dwmkerr/effective-shell/new-folder: File exists In the first call to mkdir, the folder is created successfully. In the second call, we get an error. Now let's try and use this output and make it louder - making all of the text uppercase. There are lots of ways to make text uppercase in the shell, let's use the tr (translate characters) program. Here's an example of how it works: $ echo 'Be quiet, this is a library!' | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'BE QUIET, THIS IS A LIBRARY! Now let's use it to shout out our error message: $ mkdir ~/effective-shell/new-folder | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'mkdir: /home/dwmkerr/effective-shell/new-folder: File exists In this case the output has not been made uppercase. What's going on? To understand, let's quickly review the three streams: When we are in the shell, the shell automatically writes the stderr stream to the screen. But the shell's pipe operator pipes stdout only - it is not piping our error output. And the mkdir command is writing this error message to stderr. The command we ran before: mkdir ~/effective-shell/new-folder | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' Actually looks like this: The pipe has piped the standard output to the tr program. But there is no standard output - the error message was written to standard error instead. The shell has still written it to the screen for us, but has not piped it to the tr program. So how do we deal with stderr? Here are some common options: Now this might be the ah-ha! moment if you have done some shell scripting before - some of these obscure sequences like 2>&1 might look familiar (even if it is just the thing you know you always have to Google to get right!). Let's take a quick look at some of these options. To Standard Output If we want to be able to pipe the error message to another command, we can use another redirection trick - we can redirect stderr to stdout. The characters 2>&1 look really obscure - let's break it down: Take the file with descriptor 2 - which is standard error Redirect it with the redirect symbol > - we saw this in the earlier section Redirect it into the file with descriptor (&) 1 - which is standard output Remember, there are three 'magic' files each process has access to: stdin, the standard input, which has the file descriptor 0 stdout, the standard output, which has the file descriptor 1 stderr, the standard error, which has the file descriptor 2 File descriptors are just numbers the operating system uses to keep track of files. When a program opens a 'normal' file, it'll get a new file descriptor. Here's a little example: python <<EOFimport osfor r in range(3): print(os.open('/dev/random', os.O_RDONLY))EOF This code uses redirection (see how useful it is?) to pipe a small Python script into the Python program, which writes the results to stdout. You will probably see the following output: 345 It doesn't really matter whether you know Python or not (and there weird looking EOF is a heredoc which we have a whole chapter on later). The script is just a way of showing the file descriptors that the operating system gives me when I try to open three files (each time I open the same file, the magic /dev/random file which just contains random data). The interesting thing is that the descriptors in my program start from 3 and go upwards - that's because 0, 1 and 2 are already in use, for stdin, stdout and stderr! So to make our error message go through the tr command, we can redirect stderr to stdout, which means the error message will go to stdout and then be piped to tr: $ mkdir ~/effective-shell/new-folder 2>&1 | tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'MKDIR: /HOME/DWMKERR/PLAYGROUND/NEW-FOLDER: FILE EXISTS Visually, what is happening is this: If you can wrap your head around this, the other options we showed for stderr might start to make a little more sense. A nice trick to remember the slightly obscure ampersand & which references a file descriptor - if you were to write this: cat some-file-that-might-not-exist 2>1 What would happen is that the shell would write stderr to a new file with the name 1! Why don't we need an ampersand before the > symbol, only for the file descriptor afterwards? This is just because the shell only supports redirecting file descriptors, so an additional ampersand would be superfluous. To a File Before, we redirected to &2, which is 'the file with descriptor 2. We can also use a similar trick to redirect to any arbitrary file: mkdir ~/effective-shell/new-folder 2>./errors.txt This command just redirects all of the errors (remember, 2 is stderr) to a file called ./errors.txt. This is quite a common trick - run the program, but log the errors to a file for later review. To Nowhere What if we just don't want to see the errors at all? Well there's a special file called /dev/null which we can use for this. When we write to this file, the operating system just discards the input. In fact, it exists for just this kind of purpose! mkdir ~/effective-shell/new-folder 2>/dev/null This just redirects all errors to the black hole of /dev/null - we won't see them on the screen or anywhere else. This is a common way to 'silence' errors3 in shell commands. Notice how we're starting to see patterns? This is just redirection, the same tricks we saw for stdout, but we're explicitly redirecting stderr (file descriptor 2). If we don't tell the shell what to redirect, it assumes stdout by default. So if we can redirect, can we append too? Append Yes! Just like we did with stdout, there's nothing stopping us appending to a file: mkdir ~/effective-shell/new-folder 2>>./all-errors.log Just like before, we use >> which means append (rather than overwrite or create). All to a File This is a really important subtlety. If you want to write both stdout and stderr to a file, you might try this: ls /usr/bin /nothing 2>&1 > all-output.txt If you run this command, you'll get stdout written to all-output.txt, but the error message cannot access '/nothing' is written to the screen, not the file. Why is this? Bash (and most bash-like shells) process redirections from left to right, and when we redirect we duplicate the source. So breaking this down: 2>&1 - duplicate file descriptor 2 (stderr) and write it to 1 - which is currently the terminal! > all-output.txt - duplicate file descriptor 1 (stdout) and write it to a file called all-output.txt To write everything to the file, try do this: ls /usr/bin /nothing > all-output.txt 2>&1 This will work. Breaking it down: Redirect stdout to the file all-output.txt Now redirect stderr to stdout - which by this point has already been redirected to a file This can be tough to remember so it's worth trying it out4. There are many variations you can play with and we'll see more as we go through the book.","s":"Common Patterns - Standard Error","u":"/part-2-core-skills/thinking-in-pipelines/","h":"#common-patterns---standard-error","p":244},{"i":259,"t":"This is a long chapter, but I can't talk about pipelines without briefly mentioning the T pipe.

And it has the tee command in the middle. What does this do? Well the tee command is like a T-pipe in plumbing - it lets the stream of data go in two directions! The sorted.txt file contains the sets of characters after the sort operation, but before the unique and filter operation. Visually, it does this: As soon as you visualise a T-pipe it's easy to remember this useful command!

Each section I added one by one, writing to the screen each time, until I had it working. The thought process was: cat data.dat - OK, first I need to write out the file sort - now I can sort it, that'll put all the blank lines together uniq - this'll remove all of those duplicate blank lines, although it still leaves one blank one at the top! grep -v '^#' - this should get rid of all the lines which start with # wc -l - this'll count the number of lines I'm left with Now there's probably better ways, and this has an oddity which is that if there are blank lines it'll remove all but one of them (although that would be quick to fix), but it gave me my quick and dirty answer in less than a minute.

If you find yourself struggling later you might want to quickly review this chapter, because we introduced a lot! In this chapter we looked at: How each program has access to three 'standard' streams - one for input, one for output and one for reporting errors The standard input stream is available as a file at /dev/stdin, is often called stdin in programming languages, and always has the special file descriptor 0 The standard output stream is available as a file at /dev/stdout, is often called stdout in programming languages, and always has the special file descriptor 1 The standard error stream is available as a file at /dev/stderr, is often called stderr in programming languages, and always has the special file descriptor 2 The Ctrl+D sequence means 'end of transmission' - we can use it to signal that we have completed putting our input into stdin... ...but the Ctrl+C sequence means 'interrupt' and is normally used to force a program to close We can pipe the output of one program to the input of another with the pipe | symbol We can redirect a file to the standard input of a program with the < operator We can redirect the standard output of a program to create or overwrite a file with the > operator We can redirect the standard output of a program to create or append to a file with the >> operator We can redirect the standard error of a program to its standard output with 2>&1 We can redirect the standard error of a program to another file (such as the 'null' file) with 2>/dev/null We can redirect the standard error of a program to create or append to a file, just like with standard output, using the >> operator We also briefly saw some commands: sort sorts text sed can replace content in text tr can replace parts of text wc can count words or lines of text tee takes the input stream and sends it straight to the output, but also to a file (like a T-pipe in plumbing) grep can filter lines These programs can do a lot more and are workhorses we'll see in more detail through the book.

If we temporarily empty this variable, the shell won't find the command: $ PATH=\"\" cat file.txtbash: cat: No such file or directory Normally your $PATH variable will include the standard locations for Linux programs - folders such as /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin and so on2. If you were to print the variable, you'd see a bunch of paths (they are separated by colons; I've put them on separate lines for readability): /usr/local/bin/usr/bin/bin/usr/sbin/sbin The shell will start with the earlier locations and move to the later ones. This allows local flavours of tools to be installed for users, which will take precedence over general versions of tools. There will likely be other locations too - you might see Java folders, package manager folders and so on.","s":"Executables - Programs","u":"/part-2-core-skills/understanding-commands","h":"#executables---programs","p":265},{"i":274,"t":"Imagine we create a text file called dog in the local folder that looks like this: #!/bin/shecho \"🐶 woof 🐶\" This is a shell script (you've heard this before, but we'll see a lot more of these as we go through the book!).

Let's actually do this, using the chmod (change file modes) command: $ ls -l dog-rw-r--r-- 1 dwmkerr staff 32 Oct 8 22:44 dog$ chmod +x dog$ ls -l dog-rwxr-xr-x 1 dwmkerr staff 32 Oct 8 22:44 dog I've used ls -l dog to show the file permissions of dog before and after the chmod +x dog3 command. We can see that there are some new x's in the first section. These are saying that the file is now executable by all users. Now that we have made the file executable we can run this just like any other program - as long as we tell the shell to look for programs in the current directory: $ PATH=\".\" dog🐶 woof 🐶 By the way - don't do this! Adding the special . directory to the path is generally not a safe or sensible thing to do, this is just a demonstration of how it works. More common would be to run the program by specifying the path to the file, like so: $ ./dog🐶 woof 🐶 Another option would just be to move it to a standard location that the shell already checks for programs: $ mv dog /usr/local/bin$ dog🐶 woof 🐶 Executables don't have to be compiled program code, they can be scripts. If a file starts with #! (the 'shebang'), then the system will try to run the contents of the file with the program specified in the shebang. We will look at shebangs in greater detail in a later chapter. But the key takeaway here is that we can also have executable scripts as commands.","s":"Executables - Scripts","u":"/part-2-core-skills/understanding-commands","h":"#executables---scripts","p":265},{"i":276,"t":"OK, so we've seen executables. What about a command like this? local V=\"hello\" echo $V You will not find the local executable anywhere on your system. It is a builtin - a special command built directly into the shell program. Builtins are often highly specific to your shell. They might be used for programming (local for example is used to declare a locally scoped variable), or they might be for very shell-specific features. This is where we need to take note. As soon as you are running a builtin, you are potentially using a feature that is specific to your shell, rather than a program that is shared across the system and can be run by any shell. Trying to programmatically execute local as a process will fail - there is no executable with that name; it is purely a shell construct. So how do we know if a command is a builtin? The preferred method is to use the type command: $ type locallocal is a shell builtin The type command (which is itself a builtin!) can tell you the exact type of shell command. Interestingly, you might be using more builtins than you think. echo is a program, but most of the time you are not executing it when you are in a shell: $ type -a echoecho is a shell builtinecho is /bin/echo By using the -a flag on type to show all commands that match the name, we see that echo is actually both a builtin and a program. Many simple programs have builtin versions. The shell can execute them much faster. Some commands are a builtin so that they can function in a sensible manner. For example, cd command changes the current directory - if we executed it as a process, it would change only the directory for the cd process itself, not the shell, making it much less useful. Echo is builtin because the shell can run much more quickly by not actually running a program if it has its own built in implementation. Builtins will vary from shell to shell, but many shells are 'Bash-like' - meaning they will have a set very similar to the Bash builtins, which you can see here: https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Builtins.html As should be familiar from Chapter 5 - Getting Help, you can get help for builtins: $ man source # source is a builtinBUILTIN(1) BSD General Commands Manual BUILTIN(1)NAME builtin, !, %, # ...snip...SYNOPSIS builtin [-options] [args ...] However, the manual will not show information on specific builtins, which is a pain. Your shell might have an option to show more details - for example, in Bash you can use help: $ help sourcesource: source filename [arguments] Read and execute commands from FILENAME and return. The pathnames in $PATH are used to find the directory containing FILENAME. If any ARGUMENTS are supplied, they become the positional parameters when FILENAME is executed. But remember: help is a builtin; you might not find it in all shells (you won't find it in zsh, for example). This highlights again the challenges of builtins.","s":"Builtins","u":"/part-2-core-skills/understanding-commands","h":"#builtins","p":265},{"i":278,"t":"You can define your own shell functions. We will see a lot more of this later, but let's show a quick example for now: $ restart-shell () { exec -l $SHELL } This snippet creates a function that restarts the shell (quite useful if you are messing with shell configuration files or think you might have irreversibly goofed up your current session). We can execute this function just like any command: $ restart-shell And running type will show us that this is a function: $ type restart-shellrestart-shell is a functionrestart-shell (){ exec -l $SHELL} Functions are one of the most powerful shell constructs we will see; they are extremely useful for building sophisticated logic.

We can quickly define aliases to save on keystrokes. For example: $ alias k='kubectl' From this point on, I can use the k alias as shorthand for the kubectl command.

No normal programs will talk to hardware directly - the operating system abstracts this hardware away and provides a software interface to it. The abstraction the operating system provides is essential. Developers don't need to know the specifics of how to work with individual devices from different vendors; the operating system provides a standardised interface to all of this. It also handles various tasks such as making sure the system starts up properly.

Software running in the kernel has direct access to resources, so is extremely sensitive. The kernel will balance resources between the programs in user space, which we'll look at shortly. If you've ever had to install 'drivers', these are examples of pieces of software that will run in the kernel - they'll have direct access to a physical device you've installed, and expose it to the rest of the software on the computer. Why 'kernel'? The kernel is the soft, edible part of a nut or seed, which is surrounded by a shell. Below you can see a walnut - the kernel is the soft bit in the middle, and the shell surrounds and protects it. This is a useful metaphor that is used for parts of a computer. (By Kkchaudhary11 - Own work, CC BY-SA 4.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=49069244) The operating system kernel really is the core of the operating system. It's such a sensitive area of the operating system that we actually want to avoid running software in it if possible5. And that is where user space comes in.","s":"The Kernel","u":"/part-2-core-skills/what-is-a-shell","h":"#the-kernel","p":303},{"i":318,"t":"The vast majority of programs run in 'user space' (also commonly called 'user land'). When a program starts, the kernel will allocate it a private segment of memory and provide limited access to resources. The program is given access to a library of functions by the operating system, which it can use to access resources such as files, devices and so on. Programs in user space are essentially in sandboxes, where there is a limit to how much damage they can do. For example, a program running in user space can use the standard fopen function, which is provided on almost every operating system as part of the C Standard Library. This allows a program to attempt to open a file. The operating system will make a decision on whether the program is allowed to open the file (based on things such as permissions, where the file is and so on) and then, if it is OK with the call, will give the program access to the file. Under the hood, this 'user space' call translates to a system call in the kernel. Now that the key components have been introduced, we can look at the shell. The name should come as no surprise, as it is a wrapper or outer layer to the operating system (which itself contains the sensitive nugget of the kernel).","s":"User Space","u":"/part-2-core-skills/what-is-a-shell","h":"#user-space","p":303},{"i":320,"t":"So what is the shell? The shell is just a general name for any user space program that allows access to resources in the system, via some kind of interface. Shells come in many different flavours but are generally provided to aid a human operator in accessing the system. This could be interactively, by typing at a terminal, or via scripts, which are files that contain a sequence of commands. For example, to see all of the files in a folder, the human operator could write a program in a language such as C, making system calls to do what they want. But for day-to-day tasks, this would be repetitive. A shell will normally offer us a quick way to do that exact task, without having to manually write a program to do it. Here's an example, where a shell is being used to show the 'png' images in the folder I am working in6: So a shell is a user-space program to interface with the computer. But there a few more moving parts than just a shell we are seeing in the image above. There are different types of shells, there are terminal programs, and there are the programs or commands that the shell calls (in the example above, tree is a program). Let's pick these apart. Here's a diagram that more accurately shows what is going on: Let's dissect this bit by bit.","s":"The Shell","u":"/part-2-core-skills/what-is-a-shell","h":"#the-shell","p":303},{"i":322,"t":"We're not directly interacting with the 'shell' in this diagram. We're actually using a terminal. When a user wants to work with a shell interactively, using a keyboard to provide input and a display to see the output on the screen, the user uses a terminal. A terminal is just a program that reads input from the keyboard, passes that input to another program (normally a shell), and displays the results on the screen. A shell program on its own does not do this - it requires a terminal as an interface. Why the word terminal? This makes sense when you look at how people interfaced with computers historically. Input to a computer might be through punch cards, and output would often be via a printer. The Teletype Terminal7 became a common way for users to interface with computers. (Photograph by Rama, Wikimedia Commons, Cc-by-sa-2.0-fr, CC BY-SA 2.0 fr, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=17821795) At this time, computers were very large, complex, and expensive machines. It was common to have many terminals connected to a single large machine (or 'mainframe'), or a few terminals that people would share. But the terminal itself was just a human interface to the operating system. A more modern terminal would be something like an IBM 3486: (By ClickRick - Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0, https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=6693700) This is a very small computer in its own right but still basically just a dumb screen and keyboard connected by a cable to a larger mainframe computer in another location. This mechanism is still very much the case today. When I want to work with a computer in a data centre, I don't go and find the machine, plug in a keyboard and a display and directly interface to it. I run a terminal program on my computer to provide access to the remote machine. My terminal program allows me to use my keyboard and display to work with a remote machine - all via a secure shell - which is a secured-shell connection over a network. So terminals in many ways are quite simple - they are interfaces. But because they are quite simple programs, we can't do much with them. So normally, the first thing that a terminal program will do is run a shell program - a program that we can use to operate the computer. There's nothing special about terminals - anyone can write a program to operate as a terminal, which is why you will see many different terminals around. Examples are the standard 'terminal' app for MacOS X, the gnome-terminal for Linux, and iTerm2 and Hyper. There's a bunch of screenshots of different setups at the end of the article.","s":"The Terminal","u":"/part-2-core-skills/what-is-a-shell","h":"#the-terminal","p":303},{"i":324,"t":"Now that we've described the terminal, we can go back and look at the shell in detail. The shell is the program that is going to take input from somewhere and run a series of commands. When the shell is running in a terminal, it is normally taking input interactively from the user. As the user types in commands, the terminal feeds the input to the shell and presents the output of the shell on the screen. A shell program can also take input from files; these files will then generally be 'shell scripts'. This might be used to run automated operations, such as cleaning up certain folders when a computer starts. Shells can write output to files or other locations, and so on. You can run a shell program outside of a terminal - you just won't be able to interface with it using a keyboard or display. And in fact, lots of operations happen in this way: automated scripts, startup tasks, installers and so on. So what else does a shell do? Most of the features are related to helping human operators work with the system more efficiently. Quickly enter commands, see the history of commands and quickly restructure commands (see Chapter 8 - Fly on the Command Line) Navigate through the file system, moving from folder to folder (see Chapter 1- Navigating Your System), which makes it easier for an operator to navigate the file system Chain the output of commands together - for example, taking the output of one basic program, such as the tree program we saw, and writing it to a file (see Chapter 7 - Thinking in Pipelines) Offer a programming language, allowing the operator to perform more complicated tasks And a lot more! In fact, that's what the whole book is about - how to get the most from these powerful programs, particularly for those who use them regularly.","s":"Back to the Shell","u":"/part-2-core-skills/what-is-a-shell","h":"#back-to-the-shell","p":303},{"i":326,"t":"The last part of the diagram, which we haven't covered yet, is the command prompt. When a shell is running in terminal, it knows that a human operator will be interfacing with it. So to make sure that the operator has some kind of visual hint that they have to enter commands, the shell will output some kind of prompt. I've included a set of screenshots at the end of the article, just after this section, and you can see how some different command prompts look. Note that shells don't have to use command prompts - if you use a shell program to execute a script, there will be no command prompt. Shells only show a prompt when they know they are being used interactively. Many programs which allow a user to operate interactively will show a command prompt. Shell command prompts can be customised, so they will often look different from machine to machine. Below is an example that shows a lot of technical information. This is from the highly popular oh-my-zsh framework for the 'Z Shell' shell, which is very popular among developers: *(Source: https://ohmyz.sh/)","s":"The Command Prompt or Command Line","u":"/part-2-core-skills/what-is-a-shell","h":"#the-command-prompt-or-command-line","p":303},{"i":328,"t":"A lot of the 'commands' in a shell, such as cat (which shows the contents of a file), are actually just simple programs, which will interface with the kernel. No matter what shell you use, these commands will behave the same way, because really all you are doing is calling another program. Some commands, such as cd (change directory), are built into the shell. Some commands are functions that have been defined, or aliases to other commands (for more details on commands, see Chapter 10 - Understanding Commands). Commands will often differ between shells. Not all shells are created equal - anyone can write a shell program, maybe creating a simple interface to the computer or a highly complex one with many features. In fact, a later article in this series will look at the genealogy of the most common shells. On most Unix-like systems, the default shell is a program called bash, which stands for \" Bourne Again Shell\" (the name and history around it will be discussed at length in the later article). But there are many other shells: the C Shell, the Korn Shell, Z Shell and Fish, just to name just a few. Users and administrators can configure what shell they like to use. When a terminal opens, it will immediately start the user's preferred shell program. It is possible to change this. Different users will have different preferences, given that shells offer varying features. This can cause complexity when working with systems, as we cannot always expect every user to have the same shell, or even for the same shell to be set up consistently, as they can be extensively customised. Let's review the earlier diagram again: We can see the real internals of what is going on in this \"Terminal -> Shell -> Program\" chain in the diagram above quite easily. Try the command pstree -psa $$ in a shell8: The first systemd process is the primary process for the OS - it is process number 1, which initialises everything else. The second systemd process is the process that is running the interface for my user. We can ignore these for now; they are internals to how the operating system boots and starts processes. What is interesting is that we can see a terminal (the gnome terminal), which has started my preferred shell (which is zsh), which is running a command (the program pstree). Here we can see the exact chain as shown in the diagram earlier.","s":"Shell Commands and Different Shells","u":"/part-2-core-skills/what-is-a-shell","h":"#shell-commands-and-different-shells","p":303},{"i":330,"t":"These are the key technologies and concepts that surround a shell. If you are interested in more technical details of working with shells, then my Effective Shell series goes into these topics in depth. The goal of this series is to help teach techniques that making working with shells more efficient. To close the article, below are some examples of different terminals, shells, command prompts and so on. Example: iTerm 2 / tmux / zsh​ In this example, we have: A MacOS operating system iTerm2 as the terminal program tmux running as a 'terminal multiplexer' (see Effective Shell: Terminal Multiplexers) zsh (Z Shell) as the shell program, using 'oh my zsh', which is easily recognised by the % sign in the command prompt. A customised command line, which shows the user and folder on one line, with only the % symbol below, to leave lots of space for the input commands9. Example: Bash​ In this example, we have: A Linux operating system (Ubuntu 14) The gnome terminal bash as the shell In the second screenshot, the user has 'root privileges', and to indicate this, bash helpfully changes the default command prompt from a dollar sign to a hash sign Example: Windows Explorer​ In this example, we have: The Windows 10 operating system No terminal The explorer.exe program showing us a graphical shell This looks different from previous examples. The program, which shows the familiar Windows interface, explorer.exe, is in fact a shell as well, offering interactive access to the operating system and computer resources. The bulk of the Windows APIs to interact with this interface are in the Shell Library. I also maintain a popular library for building extensions to the graphical Windows shell - sharpshell. Example: Windows Command Prompt​ In this example, we have: The Windows 10 operating system The command prompt terminal and shell In Windows, the terminal and shell are combined into a single cmd.exe program. There's an excellent article on the internals - Microsoft DevBlogs: Windows Command-Line: Inside the Windows Console Example: Windows PowerShell​ In this example, we have: The Windows 10 operating system The PowerShell terminal PowerShell is an improvement on the 'command prompt' program that was originally used in Windows, offering much more functionality for scripting and other modern shell features. Example: Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)​ In this example, we have: The Windows 10 operating system The Bash.exe program This screenshot, from MSDN: Frequently Asked Questions about Windows Subsystem for Linux shows Bash running in Windows. This is a relatively new feature at the time of writing, allowing Windows users to use a Linux interface to the PC. This is a feature that may become increasingly valuable, as in general it is challenging to write shell code that can run on Windows and Unix-like systems.","s":"That's a Wrap!","u":"/part-2-core-skills/what-is-a-shell","h":"#thats-a-wrap","p":303},{"i":332,"t":"If you enjoyed this article, please do share it!

We give sed an expression, which describes a set of operations we want to perform and it then applies that expression to the file we specify. As with most commands we've seen it can apply the expression to stdin. Let's look at the expression in detail: s/settings/dotfiles/ The s indicates that we are going to run the substitute function, which is used to replace text The / indicates the start of the pattern we are searching for... ...settings is the pattern - which is just the literal text 'settings' The second / indicates the start of the replacement we will make when the pattern is found The final / indicates the end of the replacement - we can also optionally put flags after this slash Just as we saw in Chapter 13 - Get to Grips with Grep, we can provide a regular expression as the pattern to search for. By default, sed will use basic regular expressions. We can use extended regular expressions by providing the -E flag. Basic and Extended Regular Expressions If you are not sure about the difference between Basic and Extended Regular Expressions, you can use the: man re_pattern Command to get detailed documentation.","s":"Replacing Text","u":"/part-3-manipulating-text/advanced-text-manipulation/","h":"#replacing-text","p":333},{"i":342,"t":"We can use the -e <expression> flag to supply multiple expressions to sed. If we wanted to delete our backup folders, we could run two substitutions - one which changes the cp command to rmdir command and one which deletes the first parameter, which was the source directory for cp but is not needed for rmdir1. Replacing Text on Specific Lines​ Let's start with the first expression, which should change cp to rmdir: $ sed -e 's/cp/rmdir/' backup-config.sh#!/usr/bin/env bash# Make sure we have a backup directory.mkdir ~/backup# Copy over alicloud, aws, azure, grmdir and ssh config and credentials.rmdir ~/.aliyun/config.json ~/backup/settings/aliyun/rmdir ~/.aws/config ~/backup/settings/aws/rmdir ~/.aws/credentials ~/backup/settings/aws/rmdir ~/.azure/config ~/backup/settings/azure/rmdir ~/.config/gcloud/credentials.db ~/backup/settings/gcloud/rmdir ~/.ssh/config ~/backup/settings/ssh/rmdir ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/backup/settings/ssh/ # is this safe?rmdir ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ~/backup/settings/ssh/ We have provided a single expression with the -e parameter. If you are providing a single expression only then this parameter is superfluous, but we will shortly add another expression. This has changed all of the cp commands to rmdir. But did you notice the bug? It has also changed the letters cp in the comment which mentions gcp to rmdir, meaning our comment line has changed. I've made the changes bold to make this easier to see below:Before, it was: # Copy over alicloud, aws, azure, gcp and ssh config and credentials. Now it is: # Copy over alicloud, aws, azure, grmdir and ssh config and credentials. This isn't the worst bug in the world, but we can do better. Let's change the expression to only run on lines which start with the letters cp: $ sed -e '/^cp/s/cp/rmdir/' backup-config.sh#!/usr/bin/env bash# Make sure we have a backup directory.mkdir ~/backup# Copy over alicloud, aws, azure, gcp and ssh config and credentials.rmdir ~/.aliyun/config.json ~/backup/settings/aliyun/rmdir ~/.aws/config ~/backup/settings/aws/rmdir ~/.aws/credentials ~/backup/settings/aws/rmdir ~/.azure/config ~/backup/settings/azure/rmdir ~/.config/gcloud/credentials.db ~/backup/settings/gcloud/rmdir ~/.ssh/config ~/backup/settings/ssh/rmdir ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/backup/settings/ssh/ # is this safe?rmdir ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ~/backup/settings/ssh/ Let's look at the expression in detail. Before the s symbol, which indicates that we are performing a substitution, we now include a line pattern. A line pattern tells sed which lines it should apply the expression to. Our line pattern is just ^cp, which is the regular expression meaning \"any line which starts with cp\". Line patterns can be quite sophisticated and are covered in the box later on in this chapter! So all in all: ^cp- use the line pattern ^cp (lines which start with cp) for the expression s - use the substitution function (which replaces text) cp - find the pattern cp rmdir - replace each occurrence with rmdir on lines which start with the text cp, replace any occurrences of the text text cp with the text rmdir We combine these parts together using a / symbol, this is needed so that sed knows where the line pattern starts and end, the function starts and end and so on2. Removing Parts of a Line​ Now we need to remove the first parameter for the rmdir command, it was used when we had cp as the command but doesn't make sense any more. Let's apply a new expression: $ sed -E -e '/^cp/s/cp/rmdir/' -e '/^rmdir/s/~[^ ]+ //' backup-config.sh#!/usr/bin/env bash# Make sure we have a backup directory.mkdir ~/backup# Copy over alicloud, aws, azure, gcp and ssh config and credentials.rmdir ~/backup/settings/aliyun/rmdir ~/backup/settings/aws/rmdir ~/backup/settings/aws/rmdir ~/backup/settings/azure/rmdir ~/backup/settings/gcloud/rmdir ~/backup/settings/ssh/rmdir ~/backup/settings/ssh/ # is this safe?rmdir ~/backup/settings/ssh/ Let's take a look at the second expression, component by component: ^rmdir - use a line pattern which matches lines which start with rmdir s - use the substitution function to replace text ~[^ ]+ - search for the tilde ~ symbol and any non-space characters, up until the first space character We actually don't even include a replacement - which is why the expression ends with // - the inside of the replacement part of the expression is empty. This means we search for a tilde ~, match everything up until the next space and then replace it with nothing - meaning we remove it! Note as well that we've used the -E flag to tell sed to use extended regular expressions. This allows us to use the + symbol without escaping it with a \\ first. In general I would recommend always using extended regular expressions as they are more commonly used and if you work with programming languages as well as the shell, those languages will likely use something closer to extended regular expressions rather than basic ones. Let's look at a few other ways to use sed for some real-world tasks.","s":"Applying Multiple Expressions","u":"/part-3-manipulating-text/advanced-text-manipulation/","h":"#applying-multiple-expressions","p":333},{"i":344,"t":"In the script we've used above, there are some comments.

This is because the regular expression matches any hash symbol # and strips everything which follows it. What about if we want to get rid of those empty lines? We can use the d or delete function: $ sed -E -e 's/#.*$//' -e '/^ *$/d' backup-config.shmkdir ~/backupcp ~/.aliyun/config.json ~/backup/settings/aliyun/cp ~/.aws/config ~/backup/settings/aws/cp ~/.aws/credentials ~/backup/settings/aws/cp ~/.azure/config ~/backup/settings/azure/cp ~/.config/gcloud/credentials.db ~/backup/settings/gcloud/cp ~/.ssh/config ~/backup/settings/ssh/cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/backup/settings/ssh/cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub ~/backup/settings/ssh/ The delete command is applied to all lines which match the line pattern. In this case, the line pattern is a regular expression, ^ *$, which matches any line made up only of space characters (including zero space characters, i.e. empty lines). Line Patterns Line patterns, which can be used on many sed functions, are actually quite sophisticated. Here are a few examples: /test/ - any line matching the pattern test /test/! - any line not matching test 6 - line six $ - the last line 1-10 - lines one to ten 1-10! - lines except _one to ten Check man sed to see more about line patterns.","s":"Stripping Comments","u":"/part-3-manipulating-text/advanced-text-manipulation/","h":"#stripping-comments","p":333},{"i":346,"t":"In a regular expression the dollar-sign $ symbol represents the end of a line.

We can improve on it by telling it to not include spaces before the colon, and be explicit that this pattern we are searching for must be at the start of the line: % grep -E '^[^: ]+:' ~/effective-shell/docs/chapter12.mdtitle: \"Advanced Text Manipulation\"slug: advanced-text-manipulationweight: 14\"2\",\"94\",\"Avengers: Endgame (2019)\",\"531\" Much better. The pattern now starts with ^ meaning 'start of line', and the type of characters we search for [^: ] is not 'anything which is not a colon or space. But we've also found a film title from the text - we can improve our pattern further by eliminating quotes, which are not valid for YAML keys anyway: $ grep -E '^[^: \"]+:' ~/effective-shell/docs/chapter12.mdtitle: \"Advanced Text Manipulation\"slug: advanced-text-manipulationweight: 14 Awesome! Building Regular Expressions I was a hold out for years, but regular expressions are incredibly useful if you take the time to learn them. Exercises like this are a great way to do it. Start simple, add the elements you need bit by bit. It's a great way to learn exactly what each element does. Avoid just searching online for the perfect expression - they'll often be very long (because they are bullet-proof and cover every possible edge case hopefully). If you are building an expression which is critical to get right, then do search online for help if you need it, but for day to day tasks, practicing like this will really help. Now let's start using this pattern in sed. Let's print all lines which match the pattern: $ sed -E -n '/^[^: \"]+:/p' ~/effective-shell/docs/chapter12.mdtitle: \"Advanced Text Manipulation\"slug: advanced-text-manipulationweight: 14 Now there are two critical things we've added to sed here while we're working. The first is the -n flag, which means no automatic printing - meaning it will show no output unless told. Then in the pattern, we finish the command with p, meaning 'print lines which match the pattern'. These options make sed behave like grep, which is useful because we are still building the command. Now let's actually quote the result. To do that, we need to find lines where the value is not already quoted - so let's add that to our pattern: $ sed -E -n '/^[^: \"]+: +[^\"]+$/p' ~/effective-shell/docs/chapter12.mdslug: advanced-text-manipulationweight: 14 Our pattern now reads like this: ^[^ :\"]+: - match the start of a line, any characters which are not space, colon or quote, which then finish with a colon and a space. +[^\"]+$ - match at least one space, then any set of characters which don't have a quote in them all the way to the end of the line. The pattern is working - its found our two unquoted keys. Now let's get it to print the substitution. First, we're going to surround the key part and value part in brackets - this will make them 'capture groups' - chunks of text we can use in the substitution. Here's how capture groups work: $ sed -E -n 's/(^[^: \"]+:)( +[^\"]+$)/Key is \"\\1\"/p' ~/effective-shell/docs/chapter12.mdKey is \"slug:\"Key is \"weight:\" We are now not just searching for a pattern, we're using the s (substitute) function to replace all of the matched text with Key is \"\\1\". The \\1 just means 'what you found in the first capture group\". We could just as easily show the value: $ sed -E -n 's/(^[^: \"]+:)( +[^\"]+$)/Value is \"\\2\"/p' ~/effective-shell/docs/chapter12.mdValue is \" advanced-text-manipulation\"Value is \" 14\" Here we're printing the second capture group. Now you might have noticed that in the key, we're including the colon, and in the value, we're including the space (or spaces). This isn't strictly right - they're the separators. So let's capture them separately: $ sed -E -n 's/(^[^: \"]+)(: +)([^\"]+$)/Key \"\\1\", Value \"\\3\", Separator \"\\2\"/p' ~/effective-shell/docs/chapter12.mdKey \"slug\", Value \"advanced-text-manipulation\", Separator \": \"Key \"weight\", Value \"14\", Separator \": \" I think this is really starting to show just how powerful sed and regular expressions are. Let's finally tie it together - add quotes around unquoted values: $ sed -E -n 's/(^[^: \"]+)(: +)([^\"]+$)/\\1\\2\"\\3\"/p' ~/effective-shell/docs/chapter12.mdslug: \"advanced-text-manipulation\"weight: \"14\" Awesome! If we wanted to actually change the file, we could remove the -n flag, so that we write out everything. This makes the p option at the end of the substitution superfluous: $ sed -E 's/(^[^: \"]+)(: +)([^\"]+$)/\\1\\2\"\\3\"/' ~/effective-shell/docs/chapter12.md > updated.md Let's peep at the top of the file we created to see if it looks right: $ head -n 10 updated.md---title: \"Advanced Text Manipulation\"slug: \"advanced-text-manipulation\"weight: \"15\"---# Chapter 15 - Advanced Text ManipulationIn [Chapter 14](../../part-3-manipulating-text/slice-and-dice-text) we introduced some simple commands to work with text - specifically `head`, `tail`, `tr` and `cut`. Now we are going to take a look at how we can perform more sophisticated tasks with text. Impressive - we've found a very specific pattern in a large file, substituted to match what we need and then saved the results. This is just scratching the surface - but even with these basic tools, there is an incredible amount you can do. For example, what about if we didn't want to quote values which are just numbers? We'd just change the pattern from: $ sed -E -n '/(^[^: \"]+:)( +[^\"0-9]+$)/p' ~/effective-shell/docs/chapter12.mdslug: advanced-text-manipulation All we've done is changed the value pattern from [^\"] (anything except quotes) to [^0-9] (anything except quotes and digits).","s":"Advanced - Surrounding Parts of Text with Quotes","u":"/part-3-manipulating-text/advanced-text-manipulation/","h":"#advanced---surrounding-parts-of-text-with-quotes","p":333},{"i":354,"t":"Here's another example which I have found useful again and again. We can use sed's text replacement capabilities to create a basic templating system. For example, let's say we have the file below: apiVersion: v1kind: Secretmetadata: name: database-credentials namespace: devstringData: username: admin password: ThisIsVerySensitive! This the definition of a 'secret' for Kubernetes. It doesn't really matter how the file is structured because what we'll do in this example could work for any file. Let's say we want to be able to not have the username and password stored in the file itself, because they are sensitive. We also want to make the 'namespace' value configurable. We can do this by putting some easy to find patterns as placeholders in the file, then replacing them at runtime when we need them with sed. First, let's create the 'template' version of this file: $ cat << EOF > secret.template.yamlapiVersion: v1kind: Secretmetadata: name: database-credentials namespace: %NAMESPACE%stringData: username: %DB_USERNAME% password: %DB_PASSWORD%EOF The first line is using a 'heredoc' to write multiple lines of text to a file. We see heredocs in detail in a later chapter. The file is also in the samples at effective-shell/templates/secret.template.yaml. Now let's apply our substitution: $ sed -e 's/%NAMESPACE%/staging/' \\ -e 's/%DB_USERNAME%/admin/' \\ -e 's/%DB_PASSWORD%/secret/' \\ ~/effective-shell/templates/secret.template.yamlapiVersion: v1kind: Secretmetadata: name: database-credentials namespace: stagingstringData: username: admin password: secret I've used the \\ backslash character to split up the command into multiple lines. This command is really quite straightforward - we search for the very obvious to find patterns and replace them with values. What if we wanted this to be dynamic, and instead of using hard-coded values get the values from environment variables? This is very straightforward: $ export NAMESPACE=production$ export DB_USERNAME=prod-admin$ export DB_PASSWORD=Dhhs22kfid9c$ sed -e \"s/%NAMESPACE%/${NAMESPACE}/\" \\ -e \"s/%DB_USERNAME%/${DB_USERNAME}/\" \\ -e \"s/%DB_PASSWORD%/${DB_PASSWORD}/\" \\ ~/effective-shell/templates/secret.template.yamlapiVersion: v1kind: Secretmetadata: name: database-credentials namespace: productionstringData: username: prod-admin password: Dhhs22kfid9c In fact, we could even take this a step further and simply replace every environment variable! file_path=\"~/effective-shell/templates/secret.template.yaml\"env_var_names=$(env | sed -E -n 's/^([^=]+)(=.*)/\\1/p')for env_var_name in ${env_var_names}; do echo \"Checking for '${env_var_name}'...\" if grep -q \"%${env_var_name}%\" \"${file_path}\"; then echo \"-> Found '${env_var_name}', expanding now...\" env_var_value=\"${!env_var_name}\" escaped_env_var_value=$(echo ${env_var_value} | sed -e 's/[\\/&]/\\\\&/g') sed -e \"s/%${env_var_name}%/${escaped_env_var_value}/\" \\ \"${file_path}\" > \"${file_path}.tmp\" mv \"${file_path}.tmp\" \"${file_path}\" fidone Now this might look like a lot at first, and to be fair it is! But almost everything here is actually using commands and concepts we've already seen. Here's what's going on blow-by-blow: file_path - we're just creating a variable to hold the name of the file, this makes it easier to apply the command to other files env_var_names=... - we use sed to get the name of each environment variable. This comes from everything before the = sign in the output of the env command. for ... - this lets us 'loop' through each environment variable name found - we'll see more about this in the sections on scripting. if grep -q - check to see if the environment variable name is used in the file... ...and if it is, get the value of it with ${!env_var_name} - the ! exclamation mark is variable indirection and is Bash specific. It allows us to get the value of a variable which has a variable name escaped_env_var_value we need to replace some of the special characters which might be in the environment variable so that they don't confuse sed sed -e run the replacement, putting the results in a temporary file... ...replace the source file with the temporary one Many of these concepts, like for loops and variable indirection we will see in more detail later. But this little snippet really shows the power of Linux, the GNU tools and the shell - we can create sophisticated operations by composing together small and simple commands. A Note on Security It is very important to be careful when running commands like this or writing scripts which use this kind of pattern. Allowing the contents of your environment variables to be put into files, or even the shell's history can be a serious security concern. As an example - note what would happen if we replaced ${DB_USERNAME} with ${USERNAME} in the script above? In Z Shell rather than the value we provided being put in the file, the actual username of the user running the script would be written (which in my case would be dwmkerr). Be very careful when working with environment variables to make sure you avoid exposing private information. Even more sensitive variables might be things like ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY} - exposing variables like this could allow attackers to start accessing resources on your cloud environments.","s":"Advanced - Template Files","u":"/part-3-manipulating-text/advanced-text-manipulation/","h":"#advanced---template-files","p":333},{"i":356,"t":"You might be aware that there is an 'in-place' feature in sed which allows you to change the file you pass it directly. This allows you to do something like the below: $ sed -i '.bak' 's/staging/production/' test.txt This would perform the substitutions and then put them in a file with .bak appended. To just overwrite the existing file, you could use: $ sed -i '' 's/staging/production/' test.txt In this case we don't append anything to the name of the overwritten file, so we end up replacing the original file itself. How the -i flag works can vary on some systems so I generally prefer to simply output the result of sed to a new file and then replace the old one. However, it is useful to know what this flag is and how it is used, as you will often see it in examples.","s":"What About 'In Place' Editing?","u":"/part-3-manipulating-text/advanced-text-manipulation/","h":"#what-about-in-place-editing","p":333},{"i":358,"t":"There is another very powerful text manipulation tool - awk.

And confusingly, lots of alternative forms as well (such as egrep, zgrep and so on). Maybe the tldr tool will provide a more concise overview? $ tldr grep grep Matches patterns in input text. Supports simple patterns and regular expressions. That is indeed a little more concise. By the way, if you are not familiar with how you can get help on commands, check out Chapter 5 - Getting Help. As the manual pages indicate, grep is used to match patterns in files. More advanced users will most likely know exactly what this means, but a more simple description is just: Grep lets you search for text or filter text. That's it. You can search in files, but you are not limited to searching in files. And you can search for literal text, such as the word 'error', or you can search for patterns. Patterns in this case means regular expressions - expressions which allow you to be more specific in how you search (such as looking for a set of 16 numbers in a row, like a credit card number, or any text which looks like an email address). You can also do the opposite - filtering out parts of text. We'll use grep to search through text.

A colleague of Ken Thompson, one of the early innovators and inventors in the Unix world, needed to edit a large file - a file which was too large to fit in ed. Ken wrote the grep program overnight to allow the file's text to be filtered - and the results passed to the ed editor!

Most shells keep a history of the commands you type. Under the hood, when you use the up and down keys to look through commands you entered earlier, or use the Ctrl-R shortcut to search through earlier commands, your shell is looking through this file. If these tricks are not familiar, check Chapter 9 - Fly on the Command Line. The file which keeps the history can vary from shell to shell. For example, on my system, my history for Bash is in the file ~/.bash_history. But most 'Bash-like' shells provide a built-in environment variable which let's you find the path of the shell history. Let's at this file: cat $HISTFILE...cat ~/.ssh/configssh bastion.cloudopshelp echohelp cdexit This file will generally contain a list of the commands that the logged in user has entered in their shell. This file will likely be huge. Let's search through it using grep! Here's how we can use the grep command to search for lines which contain the text man: grep man $HISTFILE ... man socket k describe services eventstoredb-http-management man cal gcb refactor/performance/standardise-eventstore vi src/tests/handlers/test_command_handlers.py gco src/handlers/command_handlers.py gcb feat/performance/use-eventstore-writer nvim performance.md man grep Here I can see all of the commands I have recently entered which have the text man in them. Note that the text which matches is highlighted and shown in bold. Now what if you use a different shell, or forget where the history file lives? A nice trick here is to use the history command. This command prints out the history, as well as the line number. The history command writes to stdout. If we don't give grep a source file, it will simply search through stdin. Just as we learnt in Chapter 7 - Thinking in Pipelines this means we can just grep the output of the history command! Here's how that would work: history | grep man ... 9125 man socket 9188 k describe services eventstoredb-http-management 9211 man cal 9341 gcb refactor/performance/standardise-eventstore 9344 vi src/tests/handlers/test_command_handlers.py 9347 gco src/handlers/command_handlers.py 9352 gcb feat/performance/use-eventstore-writer 9355 nvim performance.md 10002 man grep This is easier to remember!

What about if we only wanted to find the lines which start with man? To perform a search like this, we can use a regular expression. Here's how it would work: history | grep \"[0-9]\\+ man\" ... 9125 man socket 9211 man cal 10002 man grep Let's break this down. In this search, we are using a pattern to search for text. The pattern in this case is a basic regular expression. Regular expressions allow us to use some clever constructs to search for text. The expression we've used is made up of the following components: [0-9]\\+ At least one number - any character in the range zero to nine. man The literal text written, i.e. two spaces and the letters man. Now for anyone who is familiar with regular expressions, you might wonder why we have a slash before the + symbol, when the + symbol has a specific meaning in regular expressions (it means 'at least one of the previous characters). The reason we have a leading slash is that by default grep is using basic regular expressions. In general, this will be less familiar for users and will be different to what they are used to from different tools. To make regular expressions more 'standard', we can use the -E flag to tell grep to use Extended Regular Expressions. We can also use the egrep tool, which assumes the pattern will be an extended regular expression. Using either approach will work, and allow you to re-write the pattern as below: history | grep -E \"[0-9]+ man\"# ...or...history | egrep \"[0-9]+ man\" This is just a little hint of the power of regular expressions. They can be daunting at first, and many people never become comfortable with them, but I would strongly encourage you to start exploring them.

The beginning of the lines now start with the path of the file and the line number, for example: ./logs/apm-logs/apm02.logs:34906 You can take this even further: $ grep -R -Hn -i error ./logs Adding the -R or recursive flag tells grep to search recursively in folders if they are included in the search.","s":"Working with Multiple Files","u":"/part-3-manipulating-text/get-to-grips-with-grep/","h":"#working-with-multiple-files","p":363},{"i":380,"t":"As long as your remember that -i is the flag for case insensitive, it makes it a little easier to remember v for invert.

In general, I would advise against using alternatives - until you genuinely find you are limited by grep. Every alternative is another tool to learn, which might not be present on other systems you use. It is also less likely to be available if you are writing scripts or instructions for others. If you find yourself really struggling with performance - perhaps you often search huge folders of text or if you find yourself regularly struggling to find ways to craft your search patterns, then perhaps you can investigate some of the popular alternatives. But I would suggest that you master the core grep functionality first, before installing other tools.

I tend to remember it as \"Execute with Arguments\" as the name xargs sounds a little odd! How xargs is used is probably easiest to see with an example. Let's use it to build a set of commands which will remove any empty files from a folder. Before we show xargs let's create some empty files which we'll later clean up: $ mkdir -p ~/effective-shell/tmp$ cd ~/effective-shell/tmp$ touch file{1..100}.txt We're using a nice shell trick here called Brace Expansion - the shell will expand file{1..100}.txt into file1.txt, file2.txt and so on, all the way to file100.txt. We could just look for empty files in our /tmp folder for this example, but a file in that folder might be in use, so a safer way to demonstrate xargs is to use some temporary files which we create ourselves. We could search for empty files with the command below: $ find . -emptyfile1.txtfile2.txtfile3.txtfile4.txtfile5.txt... A refresher on Finding Files In this chapter we'll be using the find (find files and folders) command a lot - if you need a refresher, check Chapter 11 - Finding Files. The find command has outputted a list of files, now we want to use the rm (remove file) command to delete each one. Let's just pipe the list of files to the rm command, check Chapter 7 - Thinking in Pipelines if you need a reminder of how piping works: $ find . -empty | rmrm: missing operandTry 'rm --help' for more information. What's going on here? Well basically the issue is that the rm command doesn't actually read the list of files from stdin, the list of files has to be passed as a parameter to the command. How can we take this list of files and pass it to rm as a set of parameters? This is what xargs is for! Before we delete the files, let's just see what happens when we pass the list to xargs: $ find . -empty | xargs./file40.txt ./file8.txt ./file35.txt ./file81.txt ... By default xargs take the input, joins each line together with a space and then passes it to the echo command. The echo command writes it out to the screen. We can change the command xargs passes the arguments to: $ find . -empty | xargs echo rmrm ./file40.txt ./file8.txt ./file35.txt ./file81.txt ... Very interesting! Now we've told xargs to pass the output to the echo rm command - this just writes out rm followed by the list of files. Putting echo before whatever command you want to run is a useful way to check the command before we commit to running it. Let's finish the job and delete each file: $ find . -empty | xargs rm Done! You can run ls to confirm that the file has been deleted. This is xargs - it constructs and executes a command using arguments from standard input. Now let's see how we can take this further.","s":"Introducing Xargs","u":"/part-3-manipulating-text/build-commands-on-the-fly/","h":"#introducing-xargs","p":387},{"i":392,"t":"One common challenge with xargs is how to deal with spaces. To see what I mean, let's create three files with spaces in the names: $ touch \"chapter \"{1,2,3}.md$ find . -type f./chapter 1.md./chapter 2.md./chapter 3.md What if we wanted to delete these files? Let's try that with rm: $ find . -type f | xargs rmrm: cannot remove './chapter': No such file or directoryrm: cannot remove '1.md': No such file or directory... The file name has a space in it, which is confusing rm as it thinks we're providing six paths rather than three. We can use the -t (trace) option to see what xargs actually tried to do: $ find . -type f | xargs -t rmrm ./chapter 1.md ./chapter 2.md ./chapter 3.md... Hopefully you can spot the error - the rm command thinks it needs to remove six files, because there are spaces in the filenames and there are not quotes around the filenames to let rm know this! Fortunately, find loves xargs - they are part of the same package of tools (which is called 'findutils'). And there's a special pair of options that can deal with this. For find, we are going to use the -print0 action and for xargs we'll use the -0 option. Let's see how it looks now, then describe what's going on under the hood: $ find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 -t rmrm './chapter 1.md' './chapter 2.md' './chapter 3.md' In Chapter 11 - Finding Files we saw that the default action of the find command is -print, which writes out the path of each item found. The -print0 action is very similar - but it instead it writes out each item followed by a special 'null' character1. Now that we've told find to end each result with a special 'null' character, we just tell xargs that the 'null' character is what separates each line of input. We do this with the -0 (use NUL as separators) option. You don't need to really understand the internals - if you are a computer programmer it might make sense, this is how strings in things like the C Programming language work. All you need to know is that it means the xargs program won't get confused when it sees spaces, tabs, quotes, newlines, or anything else which might be goofy in a file name. My recommendation would be to always pair up the -print0 action with the -0 option - it means you won't get caught out by odd file names. And definitely make use of the -t (trace) option to see what xargs is actually doing!","s":"Handling Whitespace, Special Characters and Tracing","u":"/part-3-manipulating-text/build-commands-on-the-fly/","h":"#handling-whitespace-special-characters-and-tracing","p":387},{"i":394,"t":"By default xargs takes all of the input and passes it as a set of arguments to the provided command. We can see this below: $ touch file{1..5}$ find . -type f | xargs echo./file1 ./file2 ./file3 ./file4 ./file5 We don't need to provide echo to xargs, it is the default, but I have added it for clarity. But what is really important is that we have called echo once and once only. xargs has passed all of the arguments it has been given to the command. We can tell xargs how many lines of input it should use for the command with the -L (max lines) parameter: $ find . -type f | xargs -L 1 echo./file1./file2./file3./file4./file5 We've now called the echo command once for each line of input, meaning that echo has been called five times. In general if you can provide all of the arguments to a single command the system may be able to process the command slightly faster. However, if there are lots of arguments, the command itself might not be able to handle all of the arguments you give it. You can set -L to other values too - xargs will use up to the number of lines provided: $ find . -type f | xargs -L 3 echo./file1 ./file2 ./file3./file4 ./file5 Here we've allowed up to three input lines per command. You will probably not use the -L parameter very often, but it is really important that you understand what it does. And that is because many of the other options we'll use imply -L 1 - we'll see why in the next example.","s":"One Command or Many Commands?","u":"/part-3-manipulating-text/build-commands-on-the-fly/","h":"#one-command-or-many-commands","p":387},{"i":396,"t":"You have probably noticed by now that the xargs command puts the arguments it is given at the end of the command you write. What if you need the arguments to go somewhere else? For example, what if I wanted to copy every text file in a folder to another location? Here's how we might start - and what'll go wrong! $ find . -name \"*.txt\" -print0 | xargs -0 -t cp ~/backupscp /home/dwmkerr/backups ./file2.txt ./file3.txt ./file1.txtcp: target './file1.txt' is not a directory The problem is that the destination location for where we copy the files has to be the last parameter - but xargs puts the list of files at the end of the command. And by the way - we've used the -0 parameter to make sure that funny filenames are handled properly (a good habit to get into) and the -t parameter to trace - which means we see the command which will be run. So we need to tell xargs where to put the list of arguments. We can do that with the -I (replace string) parameter. This parameter lets us tell xargs exactly where we want to put the arguments: $ find . -name \"*.txt\" -print0 | xargs -0 -t -I {} cp {} ~/backupscp ./file2.txt /home/dwmkerr/backupscp ./file3.txt /home/dwmkerr/backupscp ./file1.txt /home/dwmkerr/backups Here we have set the 'replacement string' to be {}. This means when xargs sees {} in the command it will replace it with the arguments we provide as its input. The first observation you might make is that as soon as we use the -I parameter it automatically implies that we use the -L 1 parameter, i.e. we run the command once for each individual input line. For the example we have shown above, this isn't really necessary, xargs could just write all of the arguments. The reason xargs does this is that we are not actually limited to using the replacement once only - we can use it multiple times. Here's a similar example, but in this one we put .bak at the end of each filename as we copy it: $ find . -name \"*.txt\" -print0 | xargs -0 -t -I {} cp {} ~/backups/{}.bakcp ./file2.txt /home/dwmkerr/backups/./file2.txt.bakcp ./file3.txt /home/dwmkerr/backups/./file3.txt.bakcp ./file1.txt /home/dwmkerr/backups/./file1.txt.bak Because we can use the replacement string multiple times, xargs splits up the commands so it is one command per input argument. If it didn't do this and we tried the command above it would not work properly. The -I parameter is incredibly powerful, it lets us construct complex commands. You don't need to use the {} letters as the replacement string, any sequence of characters will work. For example: $ env | xargs -I % echo \"You have env var: % set!\"You have env var: SHELL=/bin/bash set!You have env var: COLORTERM=truecolor set!You have env var: EDITOR=vi set! In this example we used % as the replacement string. You might wonder why is {} so commonly used in examples or the manpages. The reason is that this is the default replacement string used by find if we perform an action like -exec: $ find . -type f -empty -exec stat {} \\; The {} characters are used as the placeholder for files found with the find command, so people often use the same placeholder for xargs, but you are not required to use these characters.","s":"Constructing more complex commands with the 'I' Parameter","u":"/part-3-manipulating-text/build-commands-on-the-fly/","h":"#constructing-more-complex-commands-with-the-i-parameter","p":387},{"i":398,"t":"The -p (prompt) option tells xargs to ask the user to confirm each command before it is run. Let's test this out by deleting a set of 'pods' from a Kubernetes cluster. You don't have to worry about what a Kubernetes cluster is, I'm just using this as an example to highlight that you don't have to be limited to using find as the input for xargs! On my machine I can show the pods available to me in my cluster with this command: $ kubectl get pods -o namepod/my-apppod/nginxpod/postgres Three pods are shown. I could use this command to build input to xargs to let me to chose which pods to delete, interactively: $ kubectl get pods -o name | xargs -L 1 -p kubectl deletekubectl --context minikube delete pod/my-app?...nkubectl --context minikube delete pod/nginx?...ypod \"nginx\" deletedkubectl --context minikube delete pod/postgres?...n This is fantastic! We've used -L 1 to make sure that we only deal with one pod at a time (rather than trying to delete all three at once) and the -p flag to ask the user to press 'y' or 'n' in each case. The xargs command helpfully shows us what it is going to do and asks for confirmation first.

You can use your favourite editor to build the script file, and you can add 'comments' to describe what you are trying to achieve (which will make it far easier to update the script over time).

So let's start by creating a shell script, which we'll run again and again. In your favourite editor, create a file called common.v1.sh and put it somewhere on your system. As an example, I'm going to create a folder called scripts in my home directory and create the common.v1.sh file there: # Create a directory called 'scripts'.# Using the '-p' flag means we won't get an error if the folder exists.mkdir -p ~/scripts# Create the script file.touch ~/scripts/common.v1.sh# Open the script file in my favourite editor.vi ~/scripts.sh I have called the script common.v1.sh rather than common.sh because in each chapter of this section we are going to improve upon the script and change the version number. So in later chapters we will create common.v2.sh, common.v3.sh and so on. These commands should be familiar. The mkdir command creates a directory. The -p (create parent directories if needed) flag stops the command from returning an error if the directory already exists. The touch command creates an empty file with the given name. Finally, I open the file in an editor. I am using Vim, but you can open this file in any editor you like. If you would like to see how to use Vim you can also jump to Chapter 32 - A Vim Crash Course. Before we run the script, let's quickly talk about comments.","s":"Creating a Simple Script","u":"/part-3-manipulating-text/shell-script-essentials/","h":"#creating-a-simple-script","p":403},{"i":414,"t":"Comments are lines of text that you add to a script or program to help the reader understand what is going on. Comments are not interpreted by the shell – they are purely for the benefit of the reader. Any text that follows a # hash symbol is treated as a comment. Whether this is text you type into a shell, or text in a shell script, the shell will ignore anything after the hash and not try to interpret it. Using comments effectively can be a huge time-saver – it is amazing how quickly you can forget what a certain piece of code means, or why you solved a problem in a particular way. Let’s look at some examples of comments. # This is a comment - we can use this to describe what we're trying to do.echo \"Hello Shell\" # Comments can go at the end of a line...# You can also use a comment symbol to 'comment out' a line:# echo \"Goodbye Shell\" There are three comments in this sample. The first comment takes up a whole line, the second comment is at the end of a line to add some explanation, and the third comment is some 'commented out' code – we've just put a hash in front of some commands so that they will not be executed. From this point on we'll use comments a lot to explain what we are trying to accomplish with each section of a script. It is generally good practice to use comments to describe your intent - why you are doing something. This is far more useful for the reader than what you are doing. The 'what' should be clear from the commands - the 'why' is the thing readers will likely want to understand. Here's an example of a bad comment: # Write the CSV file, reverse it, cut it, reverse it.cat ~/effective-shell/data/top100.csv | rev | cut -d',' -f1 | rev The comment just describes what the script is doing. But it doesn't explain why. A better comment would be: # Get the last field of each line in the csv file.cat ~/effective-shell/data/top100.csv | rev | cut -d',' -f1 | rev If you don't come from a programming background, you might think that many of these comments are a little obvious. But as you write more and more code, you'll realise that something that seemed obvious when you wrote it a while ago can look surprisingly baffling even just a few days later!","s":"Comments","u":"/part-3-manipulating-text/shell-script-essentials/","h":"#commentsindex","p":403},{"i":416,"t":"Add the following commands to the common.v1.sh file: # Write the title of our command.echo \"common commands:\"# Show the most commonly used commands.tail ~/.bash_history -n 1000 | sort | uniq -c | sed 's/^ *//' | sort -n -r | head -n 10 This is a short script, but there is quite a lot going on. Let's look at it blow-by-blow: First we take the last 1000 lines of the ~/.bash_history file using the tail command1 Then we sort the commands. This will put all of the duplicates next to each other Then we remove all duplicates and use the -c (show count) flag to count the duplicates Then we remove the leading spaces from the output (which we need to do so that we can sort properly) Then we sort numerically and in reverse - the highest count first Finally, we limit the results to the first ten items If you need a refresher on the shell history, sort or uniq the check the Slice and Dice Text chapter. If the sed command doesn't look familiar then check the Advanced Text Manipulation with Sed chapter. If you want to see a more detailed breakdown of how the script works, check Appendix - How the Script Works. But this is not necessary for you to follow the content in this chapter. Now save the file. In your shell, run the following command to execute the file: sh ~/scripts/common.v1.sh The sh (shell) command starts a new shell. When we pass the path of a shell script, the shell command will run the script and then exit. The output you see will look something like this: common commands:463 vi267 gc238 ga .212 ls169 gpo122 make dev112 gl97 gcm96 gpr You can see my most common commands are short aliases for Git commands (the ones that start with 'g'), opening Vim, running a makefile command and a few others.

The first is to run a shell program and pass the script as a parameter. This is what we did in the earlier example. Here's another example of how we could run the script we created: bash ~/scripts/common.v1.sh This is a perfectly valid technique. Now let's see the other ways we can run a script. The next way we can run a script is to make it 'executable'. This means we change the file permissions of the script file, adding the 'executable bit'. This tells the systems we can run the file. We use the chmod (change file mode) command to do this: chmod +x ~/scripts/common.v1.sh If the chmod command looks unfamiliar then check the Understanding Commands chapter. Now that the file has been made executable, we can simply enter the path to the file and run it, as if it was any other command: ~/scripts/common.v1.sh There is a problem with this approach though. How this file is executed is going to vary depending on how your system is set up2. For example, if you are using Bash, then the script will run in a new instance of the Bash shell. However, if you are using the Z shell, then the script will most likely run in the sh program (and depending on your system, this program might just be a link to another type of shell). We want to avoid any ambiguity and be explicit about what program should run our script. We can do this using a special construct called a shebang.","s":"Running a Shell Script","u":"/part-3-manipulating-text/shell-script-essentials/","h":"#running-a-shell-script","p":403},{"i":422,"t":"A shebang is a special set of symbols at the beginning of a file that tells the system what program should be used to run the file.

The name 'shebang' comes from the names of the symbols. The first symbol is a 'sharp' symbol (sometimes it is called a hash, it depends a little on context). The second symbol is an exclamation point. In programming the exclamation point is sometimes called the 'bang' symbol. When we put the two together, we get 'sharp bang', which is shortened to 'shebang'. Immediately after the shebang you write the full path to the program which should be used to open the file. For example, if you wanted to write a script that is run in Python, you could do this: #!/usr/bin/python3print('Hello from Python') If we wanted to explicitly use the Bash shell to run a script, we might use a shebang like this: #!/usr/bin/bashecho \"Hello from Bash\" What about Node.js?

This will only work if you have the Ruby program installed in the location specified after the shebang (i.e. /usr/bin/ruby). If you do not have the Ruby program in this location the script will fail to run. How can we know where a specific program is installed? There is a common trick for dealing with this issue. We can use the env (set environment and execute command) command to run a command and it will work out the path for us. The env command is often used to show environment variables, but you can also use it to execute an arbitrary command (often with a modified environment). One handy feature of the env command is that it looks through the $PATH variable to find the path of the command to execute. You can see this by running a command like the below: $ env python3Python 3.8.5 (default, Jan 27 2021, 15:41:15)[GCC 9.3.0] on linuxType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.>>> We've used the env command to run the python3 command - and it worked out the correct path for us. To use env in a shebang, specify the full path to env (which should be the same on all Unix-like systems) and then provide the name of the command to run: #!/usr/bin/env bashecho \"Hello from Bash\" Or another example: #!/usr/bin/env rubyputs 'Hello from Ruby' Using a shebang to specify the exact command to run, and then using the env command to allow the $PATH to be searched is generally the safest and most portable way to specify how a shell script should run.","s":"Shebangs - Dealing with Paths","u":"/part-3-manipulating-text/shell-script-essentials/","h":"#shebangs---dealing-with-paths","p":403},{"i":426,"t":"We have discussed how to run shell scripts. You can also use the source (execute commands from a file) command to load the contents of a file into the current shell. Remember that when we run a shell script, a new shell is created as a child process of the current shell. This means that if you change something in the environment, such as a variable, it will not affect the environment of the shell that ran the script. Let's see an example. We'll create a script called set_editor.sh that sets the EDITOR environment variable to nano. The script's contents are below (can also find it in the samples at ~/effective-shell/scripts/set_editor.sh): EDITOR=nanoecho \"Editor changed to: $EDITOR\" Let's run this script and see what editor looks like before and after: $ echo $EDITORvim$ ~/effective-shell/scripts/set_editor.shEditor changed to: nano$ echo $EDITORvim Notice that although we changed the EDITOR environment variable in our script, the change has not persisted in the current shell. This is because each shell (and in fact, each process) gets its own copy of the environment. If we want to run the commands in the file in the context of the current shell, we can use the source command to load the file: $ echo $EDITORvim$ source ~/effective-shell/scripts/set_editor.shEditor changed to: nano$ echo $EDITORnano Our existing environment has been changed.

We can now run the common command without specifying its path: $ commoncommon commands:97 gcm96 gpr... This works because when the shell sees a command, it searches through the folders in the $PATH environment variable to find out where the command is.

Let's say we wanted to find a way to see whether an arbitrary string matches the structure of a valid email address. A quick search on the internet will find a regular expression such as this: (?:[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\\.[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*|\"(?:[\\x01-\\x08\\x0b\\x0c\\x0e-\\x1f\\x21\\x23-\\x5b\\x5d-\\x7f]|\\\\[\\x01-\\x09\\x0b\\x0c\\x0e-\\x7f])*\")@(?:(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\\.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?|\\[(?:(?:(2(5[0-5]|[0-4][0-9])|1[0-9][0-9]|[1-9]?[0-9]))\\.){3}(?:(2(5[0-5]|[0-4][0-9])|1[0-9][0-9]|[1-9]?[0-9])|[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]:(?:[\\x01-\\x08\\x0b\\x0c\\x0e-\\x1f\\x21-\\x5a\\x53-\\x7f]|\\\\[\\x01-\\x09\\x0b\\x0c\\x0e-\\x7f])+)\\]) Note that I have split the expression into multiple lines so that it fits on the page.

We can build regular expressions using an 'iterative' process, starting with the basics, then adding more features as we need them. An invaluable tool I have used for this is the website regex101.com. This website not only lets you test regular expressions, it also breaks down how they work so that you can reason about what is happening. Let's take validating an email address as an example. The way I would build a regular expression to validate an email address would be to use the following steps: Create a small list of valid email address Add some items to the list which look 'kind of' valid but are not quite right Build a regular expression which matches the correct email address Refine the expression to eliminate the invalid addresses In most cases this will be sufficient.

Some you might not be sure about - such as the one with the emoji. This one is valid if someone sets up a mail server which can handle it, but probably not a good address to use as some mail programs or servers will reject it (Gmail for example, at time of writing, would allow you to send and receive from an email address like this, but not create an email address like this).","s":"Managing Complexity with Regular Expressions","u":"/part-3-manipulating-text/regex-essentials/","h":"#managing-complexity-with-regular-expressions","p":435},{"i":442,"t":"Here's how I would start building a regex for an email address: Any set of characters Followed by an @ at symbol Followed by any set of characters That regex would look like this: .*@.* The first bit, .* means 'any character' (this is what the . dot symbol means), 'any number of times (this is what the * asterisk symbol means). The second bit is just the literal @ at symbol character. The third bit is the same as the first - any characters any number of times. Let's see how that would look in regex101: Here we can see in blue the lines that the regex has matched. We can also see which part of each line corresponds to which part of the expression. But perhaps the most useful thing we see is the 'explanation' on the right which explains exactly what each character does. Now that we have a basic pattern which matches the valid address, we can refine it to eliminate invalid addresses. Note that from this point onwards we'll not show screenshots of the results as you would see them in the regex101 website, instead we'll just highlight the matched part of the text in bold, this should make it easier to read.

The complexity in regular expressions tends to come from the fact that we need to handle 'edge cases' and be very explicit about what we can and cannot allow. Let's see how we can refine this expression further to eliminate some of the invalid addresses. Let's start with @yahoo.com. It doesn't have anything before the at symbol. This is being matched by our pattern because our pattern allows any characters before and after the at symbol any number of times - including zero times. Let's change number of characters before and after the at symbol to be 'between one and many'. To do this we use a different quantifier (a 'quantifier' is the part of a pattern which says 'how many occurrences of the characters do we expect). Previously we used the * asterisk quantifier (which means 'any number of times'). Now we'll use the + plus quantifier (which means 'at least one time').

We have introduced a key concept - the quantifier. The quantifier we have used is the + plus symbol. This is the part of a regular expression which says 'how many times can a character be matched?'. There are a few different quantifiers, here is a quick reference: Quantifier Meaning * Any number of characters. + At least one character. ? Between zero and one character. {10} Exactly ten occurrences of the character. {10,} Ten or more occurrences of the character. {10,20} Between ten and twenty occurrences of the character.

The set of characters we match can be a character set (which is when we explicitly say what is allowed), or a metacharacter (which is a predefined character set). This concept is far easier to explain with an example. Let's look at the address dave@kerr@effective.shell.com. This is clearly invalid, it has two at symbols. We can use character sets or metacharacters to fix this. The reason this address matches our expressions is that we are using the . dot metacharacter before and after the at symbol. The dot metacharacter means 'any character' (except a newline). This includes the at symbol character. There are a few ways we would be more explicit. Let's look at each of them, as each one will show a character set or metacharacter in detail. Character Sets - Ranges A character set starts and ends with square brackets. We can use letters or numbers with a hyphen in-between to denote a range of characters for the character set. For example: [A-Za-z0-9] This character set matches any of the letters A to Z (uppercase) or a-z (lowercase) or the digits 0-9. Let's see how it looks with the pattern: [A-Za-z0-9]+@[A-Za-z0-9]+ dave@effective-shell.com dave@effective-shell to: dave@effective-shell.com dave@effective-shell.com <Dave Kerr> test123.effective-shell.com @yahoo.com dave@ whatever123@😂.com dave@kerr@effective.shell.com This fails to match the valid email address dave@effective-shell.com - because it has a hyphen after the at symbol, and the hyphen character is not in our character set. It also fails to match others for the same reason - we haven't got the 'dot' character in our character set. Let's see how we can do better. Character Sets - Special Characters We can add more characters to our character set. To include the dot and the hyphen, we just add them directly to the set: [A-Za-z0-9-.] That's all there is to it! We can now see our pattern is more correct: [A-Za-z0-9-.]+@[A-Za-z0-9-.]+ dave@effective-shell.com dave@effective-shell to: dave@effective-shell.com dave@effective-shell.com <Dave Kerr> test123.effective-shell.com @yahoo.com dave@ whatever123@😂.com dave@kerr@effective.shell.com However, the expression is getting larger and larger. We can use a metacharacter instead of the character range to make it easier to read. A metacharacter is a special character which is used to represent a range of characters. For example: \\w+@\\w+ \\w+@\\w+ dave@effective-shell.com dave@effective-shell to: dave@effective-shell.com dave@effective-shell.com <Dave Kerr> test123.effective-shell.com @yahoo.com dave@ whatever123@😂.com dave@kerr@effective.shell.com The uses the 'word' metacharacter, \\w. This is just a shorthand for [a-zA-Z0-9_]. But now our pattern fails again as the \\w metacharacter doesn't include the hyphen or the dot. We can fix this easily - a character set can include metacharacters! So we can just combine \\w and the hyphen and dot: [\\w+-.]+@[\\w+-.]+ dave@effective-shell.com dave@effective-shell to: dave@effective-shell.com dave@effective-shell.com <Dave Kerr> test123.effective-shell.com @yahoo.com dave@ whatever123@😂.com dave@kerr@effective.shell.com Character Sets - Negating Characters We can use the ^ circumflex symbol to negate a character. This allows us to build a character set which doesn't match a pattern. For example, we could rewrite our pattern like this: [\\S^@]+@[\\S^@]+ dave@effective-shell.com dave@effective-shell to: dave@effective-shell.com dave@effective-shell.com <Dave Kerr> test123.effective-shell.com @yahoo.com dave@ whatever123@😂.com dave@kerr@effective.shell.com We've used the character set [\\S^@] which means 'any none-whitespace character' (this is the \\S part) and 'not the at symbol character' (this is the ^@ part). Notice that in this case we have more matches - because the set of characters we are using is larger than a set such as \\w. This expression now covers the email address with the emoji, because the emoji is not a whitespace character or an at symbol. Character Sets - Escaping Characters What do you do if you actually want to use the circumflex symbol in a character set? Just escape it! This means you put a slash first, the regex will then treat the character which follows the slash as a literal character. This is how we can match special characters like square brackets. Here's an example: [\\[\\]]+ This matches square brackets between one and many times. [\\^]\\+ This matches the circumflex followed by the plus sign. If there is ever a point at which you need to use a special character in a regular expression as a literal character, escape it by putting a slash in front of it. Character Sets - Quick Reference We've seen quite a few character sets and metacharacters, here's a quick reference for some commonly used ones: Quantifier Meaning . Any character except for a line break. \\w Any 'word' character, [a-zA-Z0-9_]. \\W Any non 'word' character. \\s Any 'whitespace' character (space, tab, etc). \\S Any non 'whitespace' character. \\d Any 'digit' character [0-9]. \\D Any non 'digit' character.

Whether an expression is lazy or greedy affects how it matches patterns - basically whether it stops at the earliest point the pattern is matched, or continues until the pattern no longer matches. Regular expressions are greedy by default. This means that if you are matching a pattern, the regular expression will capture as much as it possibly can - all the way to the last match. As an example, let's look at how we might capture the contents of an html tag: <.+> This text is <strong>bold</strong>. The regular expression <.+> matches an angled bracket, then at least one character, then a closing angled bracket. Because regular expressions are greedy by default, it captures all the way until the last angled bracket on the line - i.e. everything up until the closing </strong> tag. We can create a lazy expression by using the ? question mark symbol after the quantifier - this means that the expression will capture as few characters as possible until the end of the pattern is found: <.+?> This text is <strong>bold</strong>. In this example we have actually captured two results - the contents of the opening and closing tag. Because the expression <.+?> is lazy it matches only until the first closing brace it finds, meaning that the results are quite different. To get the same results without using the lazy quantifier, we'd have to have an expression like this: <[^>]+> This text is <strong>bold</strong>. In this case we've changed the match to 'any character which is not a closing brace'.

Knowing how to make an expression lazy can also make working with regexes more straightforward. However - you might come across a few terms when you are working with regular expressions which may be unfamiliar. These relate to perhaps more advanced topics. I'll give brief overview here, but if you have had your fill of regexes for now then you can safely skip to the next section! I am not going to show examples of each of these concepts. I'll explain why after a brief summary of the concepts. Backtracking - this refers to the process a regular expression engine goes through to try and identify a greedy match. In short, it is possible to inadvertently write a regular expression which has exponential processing complexity based on the length of the input string. This has led to cases of what is called 'catastrophic backtracking' - where the processing involved to match a pattern can cause system failures or even lead to exploits1. In short - very broad and greedy expressions such as .+ (match anything at least once) may be susceptible to this problem. Be careful when writing your expressions to test them with short and long strings to see if there's a noticeable performance difference. Regex101 and other tools can show you if your expression is time consuming. Avoid this by making expressions lazy when you can and matching more explicit characters. Lookarounds are special constructs which allow you to essentially say \"find me a pattern, but only if it comes before or after another pattern\". A lookahead is used to say \"find me a pattern, but only match it if it comes before another pattern\", a lookbehind says \"find me a pattern, but only match it if it comes after another pattern\". There are 'negative' lookaheads and lookbehinds which essentially say \"find me a pattern which is not preceded or followed by another pattern\". As an example, the expression \\d+(?=€) matches digits (this is the \\d metacharacter), at least one or more (this is the + plus symbol), but only if the digits are followed by a Euro symbol. In this case the (?=€) part of the pattern is a 'positive lookahead'. I have not yet found a situation where I've really needed lookaround expressions. For example, I would simply write the above expression as: (\\d+)€ Which simply matches digits which precede a Euro symbol and puts them in a capture group. Atomic Groups are a more advanced construct which can be used to avoid backtracking which is described above. Lookarounds are atomic. Essentially when an atomic group is matched all backtracking ceases, so can provide a 'get out' clause to avoid catastrophic backtracking. This is somewhat opinionated, but in my years of engineering I am yet to find a situation which genuinely was made more simple with the use of lookarounds or atomic groups. I would instead advise that if your expression is highly complex, find a way to break up the input first and then process it in multiple steps. That will likely lead to scripts and code which is easier for others to read and reason about.","s":"Avoiding Advanced Topics - Backtracking, Lookarounds and Atomic Grouping","u":"/part-3-manipulating-text/regex-essentials/","h":"#avoiding-advanced-topics---backtracking-lookarounds-and-atomic-grouping","p":435},{"i":456,"t":"Different tools process regular expressions in different ways.

However, this generally only affects the more advanced features such as named capture groups (which is a special syntax allowing you to give capture groups a descriptive name). I would advise that you keep expressions simple if possible - if they are getting too complex then break up your input or break up the processing into smaller chunks of work!

You might use a regular expression to do a quick check on a form on a website to make sure that an email address has at least the correct structure, but you might then use a more sophisticated check later on (such as sending the user an activation email) to actually confirm that the address actually belongs to the user.

We've already seen variables a few times in this book. For example in Chapter 5 - Getting Help we saw the $PAGER variable that is used to specify what pager program should be used in the shell. When we want to use a variable in the shell, we use the $ dollar symbol to specify the variable name: echo \"Your pager is: $PAGER\" If you run this command you will see something like this: Your pager is: less By convention, if a variable is in uppercase then it is an environment variable or a built in variable that comes from the shell. An environment variable is a variable that is set by the system. They often contain useful values to help configure your system. Here's a few common environment variables we might use: echo \"Your shell is: $SHELL\"echo \"Your user is: $USER\"echo \"Your user's home directory is: $HOME\" Your output will look similar to the below: Your shell is: /bin/bashYour user is: dwmkerrYour user's home directory is: /home/dwmkerr","s":"Variables","u":"/part-3-manipulating-text/variables-reading-input-and-mathematics/","h":"#variables","p":461},{"i":466,"t":"You can create or set your own variables by simply entering the name you would like to use and putting an = equals symbol after the variable, followed by the value you would like to use. This is the one of the few times that you will use a variable name without putting a dollar symbol before it! name=\"Dave\"location=\"Singapore\"echo \"Hello $name in $location\" This will produce the output: Hello Dave in Singapore By convention, variables that you define yourself should be lowercase. This helps to distinguish between environment variables and your own variables. It is a good habit to use lowercase for variable names. Using uppercase will work, but when you use uppercase you run the risk of 'overwriting' the value of an environment variable and causing unexpected results later. For example, in this snippet I accidentally overwrite the USER variable. If a later part of the script expects the USER variable to contain the Linux username of the user then there will likely be an error because I have set it to something else! # Don't do this!USER=\"Dave Kerr\"# If I wanted to go to my home directory, this command would fail. That's# because USER should be 'dwmkerr' but I've set it to something else!cd \"/home/$USER\" If you set a system variable to something incorrect, the impact will be limited to only the script you are running or the shell session you are in, or any commands you run from the script or session - other running programs will not have their copy of the variable changed.

They are accessible in the current shell session that we are running. Shell variables are isolated to the current process. If we run another process from our shell, such as another shell script or program, our shell variables are not inherited by this process. This is by design - these shell variables are expected to be used for our local session only. If you want to ensure that a variable is available to all child processes, you can use the export (set export attribute) builtin to tell the shell to export the variable as an Environment Variable. Environment Variables are always inherited by child processes - so if you need to provide some kind of configuration or context to a child process, you will likely want to export your variable. As an example, let's set a variable to indicate whether we want to show some kind of extra diagnostic information to the user when running scripts: export DEBUG_MODE=1sh -c 'echo \"Debug Mode is: ${DEBUG_MODE}\"' Note that we are not using the DEBUG_MODE variable in the current script, we have provided a literal command to the sh program which will run in its own process. This process will inherit the shells environment and therefore can use the value of the DEBUG_MODE variable. If we did not use the export keyword then the value would be undefined in the child process. We also see another convention here - environment variables are generally capitalized. This can make them a bit more noticeable. These variables should be used with care, you could potentially overwrite a variable in your environment (and therefore the child environments) that another program has set.

To execute a set of commands in a 'sub shell', we can use the $() sequence. Everything inside the brackets will be executed in a new shell.

Rather than creating a folder called dwmkerr_backup (which is my $USER variable followed by the text _backup), the script has actually failed. That is because it is looking for a variable called USER_backup - which does not exist! To get around this we would surround the variable name with curly braces like so: echo \"Creating backup folder at: '${USER}_backup'\"mkdir \"${USER}_backup\" This script will show the correct output: Creating backup folder at: 'dwmkerr_backup' If there is ever any potential ambiguity with a variable name you should enclose it with curly braces to be on the safe side. Some people will use curly braces in all circumstances to be as explicit as possible about what the variable name is and reduce the risk of mistakes if someone later comes along to change the code. This script would be improved with the use of a variable of our own to avoid us having to repeat the ${USER}_backup text: backupdir=\"${USER}_backup\"echo \"Creating backup folder at: '${backupdir}'\"mkdir \"${backupdir}\" In this case creating a variable to save us from creating the backup directory folder name each time we want to use it.

An array is created by using the equals symbol and putting the array values in parenthesis, like so: days=(\"Monday\" \"Tuesday\" \"Wednesday\" \"Thursday\" \"Friday\" \"Saturday\" \"Sunday\") Once you have defined your array you can retrieve an element at a given index by using the square bracket notation shown below: echo \"The first day is: ${days[0]}\"echo \"The last day is: ${days[6]}\" Arrays in Bash start at index zero. Arrays in the Z-Shell start at index one - this can cause confusion and mistakes in scripts so it is something you might have to consider if you are writing scripts that can be used by either shell. There are a number of useful operations you can perform on arrays. An example of each is shown below: Operation Syntax Example Create Array array=() days=(\"Monday\" \"Tuesday\" \"Wednesday\" \"Thursday\" \"Friday\" \"Saturday\" \"Sunday\") Get Array Element ${array[index]} echo ${days[2]} # prints 'Wednesday' Get All Elements ${array[@]} echo ${days[@]} # prints 'Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday' Set Array Element array[index]=value days[0]=\"Mon\" Get Array Indexes ${!array[@]} arr=(); arr[3]=\"apple\"; arr[5]=\"pear\"; echo ${!arr[@]} # prints 3 5 Get Array Length ${#array[@]} echo ${#days[@]} # Prints 7 Append to Array array+=(val1 val2 valN) fruits=(); fruits+=(\"Apples\"); fruits+=(\"Pears\" \"Grapes\"); echo ${fruits[@]} # prints 'Apples Pears Grapes' Get a subset of elements ${array[@]:start:number} echo ${days[@]:5:2} # prints 'Saturday Sunday' It's important to use curly braces around your array expressions. Note that in the examples above when we set an array value we don't use braces or the dollar symbol - this is consistent with what we've seen so far - variable names do not have a dollar symbol when we are setting a value. You might have noticed from the examples that arrays in Bash can be sparse - that means that you can have 'gaps' in your array. Arrays can also have a mixture of strings or numbers - not every element in an array has to be of the same type.

There are many options available and you can find them all by running man bash and searching for the text EXPANSION. Let's take a look at some of the most common ones. Length The ${#var} operator returns the length of the variable var: var=\"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\"length=${#var}echo \"Length: $length\"# Prints: 43 Set Default Value The ${var:-default} operator returns the value of the variable var or the text default if it is not found: read -p \"Enter your username: \" userusername=${user:-$USER}echo \"Username: $username\"# Prints what you typed or the value of $USER otherwise Substring The ${var:start:count} operator returns a subset of the var variable, starting at position start and extracting up to count characters. If count is omitted everything from start to the end of the string is returned. path=\"~/effective-shell\"echo \"${path:0:2}\"# Prints ~/echo \"${path:2}\"# Prints effective-shell Make Uppercase The ${var^^} operator returns the value of var with the text transformed to uppercase: message=\"don't shout\"echo ${message^^}# Prints: DON'T SHOUT Make Lowercase The ${var,,} operator returns the value of var with the text transformed to lowercase: message=\"DON'T SHOUT\"echo ${message,,}# Prints: don't shout Variable Indirection The ${!var_name} operator returns the value of the variable with the name in specified in the var_name variable. This is useful if you want to get the value of a variable but don't know the name of the variable: read -p \"Enter a variable name: \" var_nameecho \"The value of '${var_name}' is: ${!var_name}\" The output of this snippet would look like this: $ Enter a variable name: SHELLThe value of 'SHELL' is: /bin/bash Notice the similarity to the Array operators such as ${#array[@]} to get the length of an array. There are a number of other operators that exist. They allow you to extract parts of a string, apply regular expressions, manipulate the case and perform a number of complex operations. I would avoid these techniques if possible as they are fairly specific to Bash and likely will be confusing to readers. Some of these substitutions are not available in older versions of Bash. If you need to manipulate text I would recommend that you use the techniques described in Part 3 - Manipulating Text. It is generally enough to know that if you see special symbols inside a ${variable} expression then the writer is performing some kind of string manipulation. Hopefully they have included a comment that describes what they are doing to make it easier to follow! You can find out more about these features in the manual under the EXPANSION section1.","s":"Shell Parameter Expansion","u":"/part-3-manipulating-text/variables-reading-input-and-mathematics/","h":"#shell-parameter-expansion","p":461},{"i":492,"t":"The read (read from standard input) command can be used to read a line of text from standard input. When the text is read it is put into a variable, allowing it to be used in our scripts. Let's see how this look in action! echo \"What is your name?\"readecho \"Hello, $REPLY\" Run the script - when you have finished writing your name, press 'enter'. This is needed because read will keep on reading until it reaches the end of a line, so we need to press 'enter' to complete the input. What is your name?DaveHello, Dave The read command reads a line of text from standard input and stores the result in a variable called REPLY. We can then use this variable to use the text that was read. Why is the variable in uppercase? That's because even though we are setting the variable itself, it is still a 'special' variable defined by the shell. It is the variable that read puts its input into if we don't explicitly tell read what the variable name should be. Reading into a Variable​ We can tell the read command to put the input it reads into a variable with a name of our choice by specifying the variable name after the command, like so: echo \"What is your name?\"read nameecho \"Hello, ${name}\" In general you should provide a variable name for read - it will make your script a little easier to understand. Not every user will know that the $REPLY variable is the default location, so they might find it confusing if you don't provide a variable name. By specifying a variable name explicitly we make our script easier to follow. This also shows good coding practices - your variable names should be descriptive, and inform the reader of what they are likely to be used for. This makes the script easier to follow and maintain over time. This is another time that we use a variable name without putting a dollar before it. It might be helpful to remember that the dollar is used when we want to use the variable and the dollar is omitted when we want to set the variable. Prompting for Input​ Before you run the read command you are probably going to write a message to the user letting them know they need to enter some input. We can either write out a message first to prompt the user, using the echo command as shown above, or we can use the special -p (prompt) parameter: read -p \"Please enter your name: \" nameecho \"Hello, $name\" Now the output will look like this: Please enter your name: DaveHello, Dave Z-Shell Note If you are using the Z-Shell, then this command will fail as zsh does not use the -p parameter for prompt. To prompt a user for input with the read command in zsh, just put a line of text after the command that starts with a question mark: read \"?Please enter your name: \"echo \"Hello, $REPLY\" Reading Secrets​ The -s (silent) flag can be used to hide the input as it is being written. This is useful if you want to read a secret such as a password: read -s -p \"Enter a new password: \" passwordmasked_password=$(echo \"$password\" | sed 's/./*/g')echo \"\"echo \"Your password is: $masked_password\" The output of this script will be something like the below: Enter a new password:Your password is: ******** This uses the same trick as before to mask the characters. Note that when we use the -s flag, the read command does not print what we've typed - meaning we don't print the 'enter' symbol that the user presses to finish entering text. This means we don't see a new line after the read command. So we use echo \"\" to write a newline before we show the output. Limiting the Input​ There may be times where you don't want to have the user press 'enter' to indicate that they have finished writing input. There are a couple of ways we can limit the input. The first is to use the -n (number of characters) parameter to limit the number of characters that are read: read -n 1 -p \"Continue? (y/n): \" yesornoecho \"\"echo \"You typed: ${yesorno}\" This script will only wait for the user to type a single character as we used the -n flag with the value 1 to specify that we want to read a single character only. Because the user doesn't press 'enter' at the end of their input, we need to add a blank newline before we show the output - otherwise it would look like this: Continue? (y/n): nYou typed: n It's only when we read a full line of text that we don't need to write an empty line. That's because when we read a full line of text we finish by pressing 'enter', which moves the cursor down to the next line for us. The other way to limit the input is to specify a character that is to use a delimiter to indicate when read should stop reading input: read -d ' ' -p \"Enter your favourite word (then a space): \" wordecho \"\"echo \"Your favourite word is: ${word}\" Because we used the -d ' ' parameter, the read command will read up until it finds a 'space' symbol. This can be confusing for users however - if they press enter then read will read it as a newline and continue waiting for a space. So you should let the user know to finish input with the delimiter you have chosen! In general using anything other than a newline as the delimiter may be confusing to the user, and also causes some problems when the user wants to type special characters such as backspace, so I would suggest that you avoid this trick. Instead, let the user type their input and then use something like sed to extract everything up to the point that you want. There are a number of other options for the read command that you can read about by typing help read. But these are the ones that I think you will see most commonly used.","s":"The Read Command","u":"/part-3-manipulating-text/variables-reading-input-and-mathematics/","h":"#the-read-command","p":461},{"i":494,"t":"The shell has some built in features that let you perform mathematical operations. You will commonly perform these operations on variables. You might assume that you can use symbols like + directly in the your scripts to perform mathematical operations - but they may not perform as expected. For example, here's what happens if you try to add two numbers together with the + plus symbol: read -p \"Enter a number: \" number1read -p \"Enter another number: \" number2sum=$number1+$number2echo \"The sum of $number1 and $number2 is $sum\" If you run this script you'll see something like this: Enter a number: 23Enter another number: 34The sum of 23 and 34 is 23+34 The result we see is not the sum of the two numbers - it is the two numbers with the literal + plus symbol between them. To tell the shell that we want to perform an arithmetic operation, rather than just write out a mathematical operator, we use the 'double parenthesis' syntax shown below: read -p \"Enter a number: \" number1read -p \"Enter another number: \" number2sum=$(($number1 + $number2))echo \"The sum of $number1 and $number2 is $sum\" The output of this script will be something like the below: Enter a number: 23Enter another number: 34The sum of 23 and 34 is 57 There is an alternative syntax - we can use the let keyword to indicate to the shell that we want to perform an arithmetic operation. This would look like this: let sum=$number1 + $number2 I've included the let keyword here for completeness, but I would recommend that you use the double-parenthesis where possible as I think that it is probably the more commonly used construct. There are many arithmetic operators available.

The order that is used if you don't use brackets is detailed in the manual page, but in general using brackets will make things clearer to the reader.","s":"Mathematics","u":"/part-3-manipulating-text/variables-reading-input-and-mathematics/","h":"#mathematics","p":461},{"i":496,"t":"With our new understanding of variables, we can improve the 'common' command we created in the previous chapter by extracting certain values into variables so that they can be more easily changed.

Create a copy of the common.v1.sh script and call it common.v2.sh and update it like so: # Write the title of our command.echo \"common commands:\"# The following variables control how the command runs.history_lines=1000 # The number of lines of history to search throughcommand_count=10 # The number of common commands to show.# Show the most commonly used commands.tail ~/.bash_history -n ${history_lines} \\ | sort \\ | uniq -c \\ | sed 's/^ *//' \\ | sort -n -r \\ | head -n ${command_count} We have replaced two 'hard-coded' values (the number of lines of history to search and the number of common commands to show) with variables, which are now easier to find and change. We have also split the command into multiple lines so that it is easier to read (as the line is quite long otherwise). If you want to replace the installed common command with this new one, update the symlink in your /usr/local/bin folder: ln -sf $HOME/effective-shell/scripts/common.v2.sh /usr/local/bin/common Note that in this command we use the -f flag to force the creation of the symlink even if one already exists in the given location.","s":"Updating the 'Common' Command","u":"/part-3-manipulating-text/variables-reading-input-and-mathematics/","h":"#updating-the-common-command","p":461},{"i":498,"t":"In this chapter we looked at how environment variables work and how we can use our own variables. We saw how to read input from the user and how to perform arithmetic operations.

This is an incredibly powerful technique and will let you create much more sophisticated scripts!

Let's take a look at a very simple function in action: title() { echo \"My Script version 1.0\"} This script defines a very simple function called title that prints out a message. We call the function in the same way we would call any command in the shell, by simply writing the name of the command and hitting enter. Here's how we would call the function: $ titleMy Script version 1.0\" Easy!

This is a feature known as dynamic scoping. Many common programming languages like Python, JavaScript, C, Java and others use an alternative mechanism called lexical scoping. Lexical scoping is a feature that ensures that you can only use a variable from within the 'scope' that it is defined. This can reduce errors - because it means that if you define a variable in a function you don't accidentally 'overwrite' the value of another variable that is used elsewhere. You can use the 'local' keyword to define a variable that is only available in the 'local' scope, i.e. the function that it is defined in. This allows you to use lexical scoping and can reduce the risk of errors. Here's an example: run_loop() { local count=0 for i in {1..10}; do # Update our counter. count=$((count + 1)) done echo \"Count is: ${count}\"} Let's see what happens if we run this function: $ run_loopCount is: 10$ echo \"Count: ${count}\"Count: Notice that because we declared the count variable using the 'local' keyword, it is only available inside the run_loop function. If we try and access it outside of the function it is undefined. In general, you should use 'local' variables inside functions. This can help to avoid problems where calling a function can have an unintended side effects: # Set a count variable somewhere in our script...count=3# Call our 'run_loop' function.run_loop# Write out the value of 'count'.echo \"The 'count' variable is: ${count}\" The output of this script is: Count is: 10The 'count' variable is: 3 Notice that even though we used a variable named count in the run_loop function, we did not overwrite the value that was set outside of the function. If we were to run the same script but not use the 'local' keyword for the count variable, we would get the following output: Count is: 10The 'count' variable is: 10 In this case calling the function changes the 'count' variable that is outside of the function. In most cases this is not going to be what you want and will just lead to unexpected behaviour later on.","s":"Variable Scoping","u":"/part-4-shell-scripting/functions-parameters-and-error-handling","h":"#variable-scoping-index","p":499},{"i":508,"t":"You can pass any number of parameters to a shell function. To get the value of a parameter, we can use special built-in variables that represent each parameter. Let's take a look at an example: sum() { local value1=$1 local value2=$2 local result=$((value1 + value2)) echo \"The sum of ${value1} and ${value2} is ${result}\"} Let's see how we can pass parameters to this function: $ sum 3 6The sum of 3 and 6 is 9$ sum 10 33The sum of 10 and 33 is 43 In this script we have used the special $1 and $2 built-in variables to get the value of the first and second parameters. At the beginning of the function I have put these variables into local variables that have more descriptive names. This is purely to make the script more readable, I could also have written the function like this: # Create a function that calculates the sum of two numbers.sum() { echo \"The sum of $1 and $2 is $(($1 + $2))\"} For a short and simple function you might just use the special parameter variables directly like above. However for anything more complex than a one-line script I think that it is generally more readable to create a local variable with a more descriptive name.","s":"Passing Parameters to Functions","u":"/part-4-shell-scripting/functions-parameters-and-error-handling","h":"#passing-parameters-to-functions","p":499},{"i":510,"t":"There are a number of special parameter variables that the shell provides. Let's see a few in action: # Create a function that sums a set of numbers.sum() { local total=0 for value in $@; do total=$((total + value)) done # Write out the result. echo \"Summed $# values for a total of: ${total}\"} We can call this function with any number of parameters: $ sum 1 2 3 4 5Summed 5 values for a total of: 15 In this script we've used two special variables. The $@ variable is expanded into a list of all of the function parameters. The $# variable contains the number of parameters provided to the function. You might recognise that these variables look quite similar to the syntax that is used to get the members of an array or the length of an array as described in Chapter 19 - Variables, Reading Input, and Mathematics. You can actually use some of the array-style operators with the special parameters variables: # Show the top 'n' values of a set.show_top() { local n=$1 local values=${@:2:n} echo \"Top ${n} values: ${values}\"} We can call this function with any number of parameters. The first parameter specifies how many of the subsequent parameters we will show: $ show_top 3 10 20 30 40 50Top 3 values: 10 20 30 We have used the 'range' operator on the $@ variable to get a subset of the parameters. This script is a little odd to read because when we set the 'values' parameter we need to 'skip' past the first positional parameter, because the first positional parameter is the number of values to show. The table below shows some of the common variables you can use when working with function parameters: Variable Description $1 The first parameter $2 The second parameter ${11} The 11th parameter - if the parameter is more than one digit you must surround it with braces $# The number of parameters $@ The full set of parameters as an array $* The full set of parameters as a string separated by the first value in the $IFS variable ${@:start:count} A subset of 'count' parameters starting at parameter number 'start' The $@ and @* parameters look quite similar. The first one is an array, just like we saw in Chapter 19 - Variables, Reading Input, and Mathematics. The second version is the parameters collected together into a single string separated by spaces (actually, separated by the first character in the $IFS variable).","s":"Parameter Variables","u":"/part-4-shell-scripting/functions-parameters-and-error-handling","h":"#parameter-variables","p":499},{"i":512,"t":"We can use the shift (shift positional parameters) to remove a number of parameters from the beginning of the position parameters list and 'shift' the remaining parameters to take their place.

Notice that we start in position 1 now. local values=${@:1:n} echo \"Top ${n} values: ${values}\"} After we get the value of the first parameter, we 'shift', removing it from the list of positional parameters so that we can deal with the remaining parameters. I would avoid using 'shift' too much - if you find that you are having to write complex code to shift parameters around you might be better using a programming language rather than the shell for the task you are performing!","s":"Parameter Shifting","u":"/part-4-shell-scripting/functions-parameters-and-error-handling","h":"#parameter-shifting","p":499},{"i":514,"t":"You can return a value from a shell function in two ways.

Here's how we could use the is_even function: $ number=33$ is_even $number$ echo \"Result is: $result\"Result is: 0 In general, this method of returning values from a function should be avoided, for the reasons we've discussed already in this chapter. It overwrites the value of a global variable and that can be confusing for the operator. A more common way to return a value from a function is to write its result to stdout - let's look at this in detail.","s":"Return Values","u":"/part-4-shell-scripting/functions-parameters-and-error-handling","h":"#return-values","p":499},{"i":516,"t":"If we write our result to stdout, then we can capture the result of a function in a far more readable way: lowercase() { local params=\"$@\" # Translate all uppercase characters to lowercase characters. echo \"$params\" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' } In this example we write the result of the function to stdout. This means that we can capture the result and put it in another variable by simply executing the command in a subshell: $ result=$(lowercase \"Don't SHOUT!\")$ echo \"$result\"don't shout! If you have a programming background it might seem very strange that you write results in a function by writing to stdout. Remember - the shell is a text based interface to the computer system. The majority of commands that we have seen so far that provide output write their output to the screen. This is what ls does, what find does, what cat does and so on. When we echo a result from a function, we are really just following the Unix standard of writing the results of a program to the screen. This is important - if we run our function directly in a shell, we can see the result written to the screen: $ lowercase \"PLEASE don't SHOUT!\"please don't shout! Remember - shell functions are designed to behave in a similar way to shell commands. They write their output to stdout.","s":"Writing Results to Stdout","u":"/part-4-shell-scripting/functions-parameters-and-error-handling","h":"#writing-results-to-stdout","p":499},{"i":518,"t":"Although it might feel a bit clunky, writing the results of a command to stdout is a tried and tested method of returning results. However, we need to be careful. Let's take a look at an example to see why! # This function creates a temporary folder for today and returns its path.temp_today() { # Get today's date in the format YYYY-MM-DD. local today=$(date +\"%Y-%m-%d\") # Create a temporary directory for today and return it. tmpdir_today=\"/tmp/${today}\" echo \"Creating folder '${tmpdir_today}'...\" mkdir -p \"${tmpdir_today}\" echo \"${tmpdir_today}\"} This function creates a temporary folder that is based on the current date. If we try and grab the result of the function and change to that folder then the script will fail: # Go to today's temporary folder.folder=$(temp_today)cd \"${folder}\" This script fails, with the output: 'Creating folder \\'/tmp/2021-05-28\\'...\\n/tmp/2021-05-28': No such file or directory What's going on here? Well in the temp_today function we wrote a message halfway through the function, showing the name of the folder that would be created. This message is part of the output of the function. Even though in the last line we echo the path to the folder, the output of the command is all of the text we have written. It is important to remember that any command you call in a function that might write to stdout could cause problems as it could write text to your output: command_exists() { if type \"$1\"; then echo \"1\" else echo \"0\" fi} What happens when we try and store the result of the function in a variable? $ result=$(command_exists \"touch\")$ echo \"Result is: ${result}\"Result is: touch is hashed (/usr/bin/touch)1 This is not a well written function, we'll look at a better way to write it next. But it shows an important challenge to be aware of - when type is used to find out whether a command exists it returns success if the command exists but also writes to stdout. In Chapter 7 - Thinking in Pipelines we saw that we can send the output of a command to the 'null' device to silence its output. We can use this trick in our functions to stop commands from 'polluting' our result: command_exists() { if type \"$1\" >> /dev/null; then echo \"1\" else echo \"0\" fi} Now if we run this command we will not get the output from the type command in our result - the output was redirected to the null device.","s":"Dealing with Output in Commands","u":"/part-4-shell-scripting/functions-parameters-and-error-handling","h":"#dealing-with-output-in-commands","p":499},{"i":520,"t":"The return (return from shell function) command causes a function to exit with a given status code. This is something that often causes confusion in shell scripts. The reason is that in most programming languages, you would use a 'return' statement to return the result of a function. But in the shell, when we return, we set the status code of the function. What is a status code? We actually touched on this in Chapter 20 - Mastering Conditional Logic. When a command runs, we expect it to return a status code of 'zero' to indicate success. Any non-zero status code is used to specify an error code. Let's see how we could re-write the command_exists function to set a status code: command_exists() { if type \"$1\" >> /dev/null; then return 0 else return 1 fi} Now that our command sets a status code properly, we can use it in an 'if statement' like so: if command_exists \"common\"; then echo \"The 'common' command is installed on your system\"else echo \"The 'common' command is not installed on your system\"fi Remember - only use the 'return' command to set a status code. Many shells will only allow values from 0-255 to be set, and most users will expect that a command should return zero for success and that any non-zero value is an error code. If you need to provide output for a command that is not just a status code, you should write it to stdout or if you must, set the value of a global variable. The result of the last executed command is always available in the special variable $?. Here's how you could use it: $ type \"test\"test is a shell builtin$ echo \"Result: $?\"Result: 0","s":"Returning Status Codes","u":"/part-4-shell-scripting/functions-parameters-and-error-handling","h":"#returning-status-codes","p":499},{"i":522,"t":"When you run a shell script, if a command in the script fails, the script will continue to run. Like many other points in this chapter this might seem unintuitive if you come from a programming background, but this makes sense in the shell - if the shell was to terminate whenever a command fails it would be very difficult to use interactively. Let's create a script called 'today' that makes a new temporary folder each day, then puts a link to that folder in our home directory: #!/usr/bin/env sh# Get today's date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.today=$(date +\"%Y-%m-%d\")# Create the path to today's temp folder and then make sure the folder exists.temp_path=\"/tmp/${today}\"mkdir -p \"${temp_path}\"# Now that we've created the folder, make a symlink to it in our homedir.ln -sf \"${temp_path}\" \"${HOME}/today\" # Write out the path we created.echo \"${temp_path}\" Now we can run the script to create temporary folder for the current day and a link to it in our home directory: $ chmod +x ./today.sh$ ./today.sh/tmp/2021-05-28$ cd ~/today In this example we created a new directory in the tmp folder and created a link to it in our home directory. But what happens if we cause one of the commands to fail? First, let's clean up the folder we created: $ rm -rf $(./today.sh)$ rm ~/today Now we'll create a file where we want to put our 'today' folder: $ touch \"/tmp/$(date +\"%Y-%m-%d\")\" If we run our script now, we can see a problem: $ ./today.shmkdir: /tmp/2021-05-28: Not a directory/tmp/2021-05-28$ cd ~/todaybash: cd: /home/dwmkerr/today: Not a directory The mkdir command failed - because there was a file in the location where we wanted to create the folder. But the script kept on running - meaning that it created a symlink to this file. Now when we try to move to the today folder we get another error - it is a link to a file not a folder. In general in your shell scripts if a command fails you probably want the entire script to stop executing. Otherwise you can get this cascading effect as commands continue to return even after there was a failure, which can lead to all sorts of unexpected behaviour. You can use the set (set option) command to set an option in the shell. There is an option that tells the shell to exit when a command fails. Here's how we would use it: #!/usr/bin/env sh# Exit if any command fails.set -e# ... The 'set' command allows you to turn on and turn off shell options. The 'e' option means 'exit if any command exits with a non-zero status'. Now let's clean up again: $ rm -rf $(./today.sh)$ rm ~/today And finally, we'll run the same script after creating the file that will cause a failure: $ touch \"/tmp/$(date +\"%Y-%m-%d\")\"$ ./today.shmkdir: /tmp/2021-05-28: Not a directory In this case the script stopped running as soon as there was a failure - after the mkdir command failed. One thing to be aware of is that the set -e option only affects the final command of a pipeline. This means that if you have a pipeline such as the below: grep '[:space:]*#' ~/effective-shell/scripts/common.sh | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z' Then the script will still run if the grep command fails. To ensure that the shell terminates if a command in a pipeline fails we must set the pipefail option: set -o pipefail If you set your scripts up so that they fail on errors (and this is probably something you should always do), then remember to make sure that commands that you expect might fail are properly handled. For example, if we want to delete a file in script but don't want to stop if the deletion fails for some reason, we could use an if block to 'catch' the error and show a warning: if ! [ rm ~/my-file.text ]; then echo \"warning: unable to delete file\"fi Another option would be to use a conditional expression: rm ~/my-file.txt || true This expression always evaluates to 'true' so will not stop the script if an error occurs when running the rm command.","s":"Error Handling","u":"/part-4-shell-scripting/functions-parameters-and-error-handling","h":"#error-handling","p":499},{"i":524,"t":"In some scripts you might see functions defined using the function keyword, as below: function title() { echo \"My Script version 1.0\"} The 'function' keyword is not required.

Using the function keyword has a minor benefit that it does not lead to an error if you have already defined an alias with the same name as the function you are declaring. However, the drawback is that it is less standard and therefore less portable. I would recommend that you do not use the 'function' keyword. Firstly, this will make your scripts more portable. Secondly, if your function is going to clash with the name of an alias that has already been defined, I would actually think that it is better that the script fails. Better to fail early and realise there is clash than to silently overwrite the alias which may cause unexpected errors later on when something else tries to call the alias and calls your function instead!","s":"The Function Keyword","u":"/part-4-shell-scripting/functions-parameters-and-error-handling","h":"#the-function-keyword","p":499},{"i":526,"t":"Everything we have learned about parameters applies to scripts themselves.

The exit command exits the current shell with the provided status code. Be careful when using the exit command - if you are running a script then it is fine to use exit, it will simply close the subshell that the script is running in.

First, let's make sure we exit the script if one of the commands fails: # Exit if any command fails.set -e Next, we will update the script on line 7 so that we use the first parameter as the command count. If the first parameter is not set, we default to ten: # ...command_count=${1:-10} # The number of common commands to show# ... Here we are using the $1 variable. But we are also using Shell Parameter Expansion as described in Chapter 19 - Variables, Reading Input, and Mathematics to provide a default value to use if the parameter is not set. Next, let's change the line that writes out the count and the name of the command. At the moment, the count is shown and then the command name. Let's write a function that takes a number and line of text and writes it as a line of text with the number after the text and in brackets: write_command_then_count() { # Get the command and count, this will be text that looks like: # '43 git commit' # Then write the command and the count afterwards. local line=\"$1\" local count=$(echo \"${line}\" | cut -d' ' -f1) local command=$(echo \"${line}\" | cut -d' ' -f2-) echo \"${command} (${count})\"} We can now re-write our loop to make it a little cleaner: for command in $commandsdo echo \"$counter: $(write_command_then_count \"$command\")\" counter=$((counter + 1))done The updated script is in the samples folder at ~/effective-shell/scripts/common.v5.sh, you can update your link to point to this version by running the ln command: ln -s ~/effective-shell/scripts/common.v5.sh /usr/local/bin/common Now when we run this command we can optionally provide the number of commands to show as a parameter.

In just the same way we can use wildcards in commands such as ls or cp or mv, we can also use them in for loops - or in fact any statement1! You will also see that when we specify the name of the variable to use in the loop (which in this example was item) we don't need to use a dollar symbol. Remember - when we are setting a variable, we don't use a dollar symbol, we only use the dollar symbol when we want to get the value of the variable. The for loop is closed with the done keyword. Here we can also see an inconsistency with the shell syntax - for the if statement, the statement is closed with if backwards (fi). But the for loop is closed with done. The shell is an old platform and there are some oddities like that that you might not see in more modern programming languages.","s":"The For Loop","u":"/part-4-shell-scripting/loops-and-working-with-files-and-folders","h":"#the-for-loop-index-","p":531},{"i":536,"t":"In Chapter 19 - Variables, Reading Input, and Mathematics we saw how to create arrays.

It's important to remember that we want to go through every item in the array, so we have to use the ${days[@]} syntax. This is the syntax for 'all of the members of the array'. The -n (don't output a trailing newline) flag of the echo command is used inside the for loop so that we don't write each day on its own line.","s":"For Loops - Arrays","u":"/part-4-shell-scripting/loops-and-working-with-files-and-folders","h":"#for-loops---arrays","p":531},{"i":538,"t":"The for loop documentation names the input to the loop as 'words'. We can see this by running help for: $ help forfor: for NAME [in WORDS ... ] ; do COMMANDS; done Execute commands for each member in a list.... The reason that the items are called 'words' is that the shell splits up the input into a set of words and loops though each - this can be a real surprise if you come from a programming background. Let's see what this means with an example: sentence=\"What can the harvest hope for, if not for the care of the Reaper Man?\"for word in $sentencedo echo \"$word\"done The output of this will be: Whatcantheharvesthopefor,ifnotforthecareofthereaperman? Z-Shell - if you are using Z-Shell then the sentence will not be split up into words. There is an appendix at the end of the chapter that describes the differences between Z-Shell and Bash-like shells (which tend to be closer to the Posix standard). The for loop has split up the sentence variable into a set of words. This might seem illogical, as the shell is making quite a big assumption (that the operator wants their input split up), but we'll see with a few examples how this is often what is needed. This is not how most programming languages would work, so why does the shell do this? The reason is that the shell is a text based environment and the designers have taken this into account. Most of the time when we are running shell commands in a terminal we are running commands that simply output text. If we want to be able to use the output of these commands in constructs like loops, the shell has to decide how to split the output up. For example, let's see how the ls command would write its output: $ ls ~/effective-shelldata docs logs pictures programs quotes scripts templates text websites The output of the ls program is plain text. It is not an array, it is just a set of files separated by spaces. What would we expect the shell to do if we ran the following command? files=$(ls ~/effective-shell)for file in $filesdo echo \"Found: $file\"done The output is: Found: dataFound: docsFound: logsFound: picturesFound: programsFound: quotesFound: scriptsFound: templatesFound: textFound: websites Here we see why the shell splits up words in a sentence. It is making a best effort with plain text - trying to split plain text up into sensible 'chunks'. When we operate in a shell for day to day work we don't have to use the more specific syntax that would be used in a programming language - the shell has more of an emphasis on terseness of statements and the ability to quickly work with files. It is not designed as a general purpose programming tool, so it makes assumptions like this. We go into detail in word splitting nearer the end of this chapter.","s":"For Loops - Words","u":"/part-4-shell-scripting/loops-and-working-with-files-and-folders","h":"#for-loops---words","p":531},{"i":540,"t":"One of the most common scenarios for using a for loop is to loop through a set of files or folders. The most simple way to do this is to use a simple wildcard pattern in the for loop statement, like so: for script in ~/effective-shell/scripts/*.shdo echo \"Found script: $script\"done We will see output that looks like this: Found script: /home/dwmkerr/effective-shell/scripts/common.mac.shFound script: /home/dwmkerr/effective-shell/scripts/common.shFound script: /home/dwmkerr/effective-shell/scripts/common.v1.shFound script: /home/dwmkerr/effective-shell/scripts/common.v2.shFound script: /home/dwmkerr/effective-shell/scripts/common.v3.shFound script: /home/dwmkerr/effective-shell/scripts/show-info.sh We have to be careful with scripts like this - there is a bug. By default, if the shell doesn't find anything with a wildcard pattern it does not expand it. This is very confusing - so let's see an example. Take a look at the sample below - what would you expect it to show? for script in ~/bad-shell/scripts/*.shdo echo \"Found: $script\"done You might think the logical result is that nothing is printed - there is not a bad shell folder, so the pattern should not find any files. But instead, we see the following output: Found: ~/bad-shell/scripts/*.sh By default, if a shell 'glob' (a pattern that includes a wildcard) does not match any files, the shell simply leaves the pattern as-is. There are two ways we can deal with this problem. The first way is to enable the 'nullglob' (return null for unmatched globs) option: shopt -s nullglobfor script in ~/bad-shell/scripts/*.shdo echo \"Found: $script\"done The shopt (set and unset shell option) command is used to configure shell options. We will be looking at shell options in detail in Part 5. The 'nullglob' option changes the shell behaviour so that if a wildcard pattern does not match any results, it is set to null string2. The second way we can deal with this problem is to just use a test command. I think that this is actually far more readable than the shopt solution. Here's how it would look: for script in ~/bad-shell/scripts/*.shdo # If the file / folder doesn't exist, skip it. if ! [ -e \"$script\" ]; then continue; fi echo \"Found: $script\"done Here we use the -e (exists) operator in a test command to check whether the file exists. If it does not exist, we run the continue statement. The continue statement 'skips' the current item in the loop and moves to the next one. We will see it a little more later on.","s":"For Loops - Files with Wildcards","u":"/part-4-shell-scripting/loops-and-working-with-files-and-folders","h":"#for-loops---files-with-wildcards","p":531},{"i":542,"t":"If the files that you are trying to loop through are too complex to match with a shell pattern, you can use the find command to search for files, then loop through the results. If you are not familiar with the find command, check Chapter 11 - Finding Files. Let's use the find command to run a loop that prints every symlink in the user's home directory. But before we run the loop we'll create a symlink with a space - this will cause some interesting output in our script: # Create a symlink to 'effective-shell' that has a space in it...ln -s ~/effective-shell ~/effective\\ shell# Find all symlinks and print each one.links=$(find ~ -type l)for link in $linksdo echo \"Found Link: $link\"done You will see a few different links shown when you run this script, depending on how your system is set up. But you will also certainly see the results below: ...Found Link: /home/dwmkerr/effective-shell/effectiveFound Link: shell... This is clearly a problem - the shell has taken the path that has a space - /home/dwmkerr/effective-shell/effective shell and performed word splitting and turned it into two separate items. This is a persistent headache for anyone who needs to build shell scripts. There are a large number of ways to solve this problem, and none of them are particularly intuitive. I am going to demonstrate one common solution, which is not perfect but should cover most cases. I'll then suggest a better work-around. The solution that we will use is to temporarily change the values that the shell uses to split text into words. We will set it to only split on newlines. The find command puts each file it finds on its own line. This means we will not split up files with spaces or other whitespace in the name: # Save the current value of IFS - so we can restore it later. Split on newlines.old_ifs=$IFSIFS=$'\\n'# Find all symlinks and print each one.links=$(find ~ -type l)for link in $linksdo echo \"Found Link: $link\"done# Restore the original value of IFS.IFS=$old_ifs If you run this command now you will see the correct output: ...Found Link: /home/dwmkerr/effective-shell/effective shell... This will cover you in most cases. However, this method is not ideal for a number of reasons: It is quite verbose - we have to store the current value of $IFS and then reset it later It is not quite foolproof - filenames on some systems can have a newline character and this script would fail for those files We have to use the complex looking 'ANSI C Quoting' syntax to set $IFS to a newline3 If the reader doesn't know what $IFS is then the entire script will be difficult to follow The $IFS variable can be complex to work with and discussed at the end of the chapter. I believe that in this case it is probably best to not use a shell script. There is no solution that is particularly clean or simple. In this case I think you might be better off using a programming language.

The first is in 'initialise' expression, this is typically used to setup the initial state of the loop. The second is the 'conditional' expression, this is used to check whether the loop is complete. The third is the 'iterate' expression, this is evaluated after the loop commands are completed.

For example, the loop below could be used as a way to loop through the numbers from one to ten: for i in {1..10}do echo \"Loop ${i}\"done Brace expansion can be used to loop through a sequence of values or a range of numbers. You can even specify the 'increment' used in a sequence. For example, this loop iterates through a sequence of numbers adding five each time: for i in {0..25..5}do echo \"Loop ${i}\"done The output of this loop would be: Loop 0Loop 5Loop 10Loop 15Loop 20Loop 25","s":"For Loops - Looping over Sequences","u":"/part-4-shell-scripting/loops-and-working-with-files-and-folders","h":"#for-loops---looping-over-sequences","p":531},{"i":548,"t":"The while loop is a loop that executes commands until a certain condition is met.

After the conditional commands have been run, the loop goes 'back to the start' and evaluates the test commands again. Here's an example of how a while loop can be used to generate a list of random numbers: # Create an empty array of random numbers.random_numbers=()# As long as the length of the array is less than five, continue to loop.while [ ${#random_numbers[@]} -lt 5 ]do # Get a random number, ask the user if they want to add it to the array. random_number=$RANDOM read -p \"Add $random_number to the list?

This uses shell redirection to redirect the contents of the ~/effective-shell/data/top100.csv file into the read command in the while loop. The read command will read the file, line by line, until it finds the final line. This script has some issues: If the last line is does not end with a newline, then it is not read Backlashes will be treated as escape sequences and lead to broken output Leading whitespace will be removed It is possible to avoid these issues, but the resulting script is a lot harder to read: while IFS=\"\" read -r line || [ -n \"$line\" ]; do echo \"Read: $line\"done < ~/effective-shell/data/top100.csv In this case we've had to use some complex tricks to avoid each issue: The || [ -n \"$line\"] test ensures that the loop iterates as long as the line read is not zero-length, ensuring we read the last line even if it doesn't have a newline The -r (do not escape) option for read ensures that backlashes are not interpreted as escape sequences The IFS=\"\" temporarily disables any word splitting in the loop, meaning that we do not lose leading whitespace However this still has issues - if commands in the loop read from standard input then the loop will still have errors. For this reason, I would again suggest you follow the advice in the How to avoid scripting! Chapter to see better ways to read files! Even though I would recommend using a programming language to read the lines of a file, I have kept this example here because it is something you are likely to come across if you see scripts written by others.

While loops are going to be more familiar to readers as they exist in many programming languages - until loops are a little more rare.

For example, we could re-write the loop created before like so: random_number=\"\"while [ \"${#random_number}\" -lt 15 ]do random_number+=$RANDOMdoneecho \"Random Number: ${random_number}\" In this case we've changed the condition from -ge 15 (greater than or equal to fifteen) to -lt 15 (less than fifteen).

You can use as many continue statements as you like in a loop. Here's an example of a script that let's the users show the contents of a directory. If the directory is empty it uses the continue statement to skip to the next directory. If the users chooses to cancel the operation, it uses the break statement to stop iterating: echo \"For each folder, choose y/n to show contents, or c to cancel.\"for file in ~/*do # If the file is not a directory, or it cannot be searched, skip it. if !

If you type for script in *.sh and press enter, the shell will let you type the next line. You can keep on adding lines until you type done and press enter. If you want to make a really compact for loop, you can actually skip the in <words> part. If in <words> is omitted then the special 'all parameters' variable $@ is used.

In the first example the loop iterates over the $sentence variable. Note that this variable is not quoted. This means that it follows the standard rules for 'expansion' in the shell. This means that as well as all of the usual features such as wildcard expansion, word expansion will occur. In the second example, the loop iterates over the \"$sentence\" variable. Note that this variable is quoted. As we saw in Chapter 19 quoting a variable means that it is treated literally, expect for parameter expansion. This means that in most circumstances you probably want to quote your variables - otherwise the shell is going to perform word splitting on them. But if you do want expansion and splitting to occur, then you should not quote text. For example, if we run the following we see invalid output: $ for file in \"*\"; do echo \"Found: $file\"; doneFound: * Because we have quoted the asterisks, the shell does not treat it as a special character which expands into a list of files. What about this example, when we use wildcard expansion to list files, but the results do not have word splitting applied? $ touch file\\ with\\ spaces.test$ for file in *.test; do echo \"Found: $file\"; doneFound: file with spaces.test The *.test is not surrounded in quotes, so it is expanded. But why does word splitting not happen? The reason is that the shell applies these 'expansions' in a certain order, which is as follows: Brace expansion Tilde expansion Parameter and variable expansion Command substitution Arithmetic expansion Word splitting Pathname expansion Word splitting happens before pathname expansion, and it is pathname expansion that turns the asterisks wildcard into the list of files. At the point that this happens, word splitting has already been applied and won't be applied again. Each of these types of expansion we have actually already seen in the book, but we're going to review them in detail in the final section on advanced techniques.

This behaviour makes sense when running an interactive shell - we don't want the shell to close if a command fails. For a shell script however, continuing after an error has occurred is most likely going to lead to unexpected behaviour. There are two options that you will often see set at the top of a script: set -eset -o pipefail The first option ensures that the shell script will abort if a command fails. The second option ensures that if a command that is part of a pipeline fails, then the shell script fails. Even when the set -e option is set, only the final command in a pipeline will cause the script to exit if it fails. Here's an example showing why these options are useful: # Create the effective shell folder.mkdir -p ~/effective-shell# Download and untar the effective shell samples.samples_uri='https://https://effective-shell.com/downloads/effective-shell-samples.tar.gz'$ sudo wget -c \"${samples_uri}\" -O - | tar -xz -C ~/effective-shell If we don't include the set -e option, then if the mkdir -p command fails, the script will continue to run. We will then attempt to download and untar a file into a folder that does not exist. Why would mkdir -p fail? Although mkdir -p succeeds even if the folder exists, it will still fail if there is a file in the location specified, or there are not permissions to create the folder and so on. So even commands that you assume should run successfully you have to be careful with. In the second part of this snippet, we use the wget (web get) command to download the samples and pipe the results to tar to extract them. If we have only set set -e, then if wget fails (for example if the address is wrong or we are offline) then the shell will not abort the script and continue trying to run the subsequent commands, which are not going to work as expected. If you have a command that you expect may fail, but want to continue execution even if it does fail, then use the || operator: # Remove the shell configuration.rm \"$HOME/.shell.sh\" || true In this case I have used a conditional operator, as described in Chapter 20 - Mastering Conditional Logic, to ensure that even if the rm command fails for some reason, the overall result of the statement will be true and the script will not exit.

This option is incredibly useful for debugging shell scripts. When the trace option is set, the shell will write out each statement before it is evaluated. Let's see just how useful this is with an example! # today.sh - creates a 'today' symlink in the home directory folder to a fresh# temporary folder each day.# Enable tracing in the script.set -x# Get today's date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.today=$(date +\"%Y-%m-%d\")# Create the path to today's temp folder and then make sure the folder exists.temp_path=\"/tmp/${today}\"mkdir -p \"${temp_path}\"# Now that we've created the folder, make a symlink to it in our homedir.ln -sf \"${temp_path}\" \"${HOME}/today\"# Disable tracing now that we are done with the work.set +x# Write out the path we created.echo \"${temp_path}\" Notice that we use set -x to enable tracing early on in the script, and set +x to disable tracing towards the end.

The parameters are expanded, which can make it far easier to see what is going on and troubleshoot issues. The + symbol is written at the start of each trace line, so that you can differentiate it from normal output that you write in your script1. The final line of output in the example above does not have a + in front of it - because it is actual output from an echo command, rather than a trace line. The number of + symbols indicates the 'level of indirection' - this is how many sub-shells you are in. Each subshell is traced on its own line. This makes tracing complex commands far easier: set -xecho \"Name of home folder is $(basename $(echo ~) )\" The output of this command is: +++ echo /home/dwmkerr++ basename /home/dwmkerr+ echo 'Name of home folder is dwmkerr'Name of home folder is dwmkerr Notice that each subshell command is shown with an additional plus as it gets more nested. The nested commands are shown in the order that they are evaluated. I often start my shell scripts with a snippet like this: # Fail on errors in commands or in pipelines.set -eset -o pipefail# Uncomment the below if you want to enable tracing to debug the script.# set -x This combines the first two patterns we've seen - failing on errors and having the option to trace a script.","s":"Debugging Shell Scripts","u":"/part-4-shell-scripting/useful-patterns-for-shell-scripts","h":"#debugging-shell-scripts","p":573},{"i":580,"t":"The declare (set variable values and attributes) command can be used to explicitly declare that we are creating a variable.

This can be used to show all of the variables of a certain type. Here's an example to show all associative arrays that have been created: $ declare -p -Adeclare -A BASH_ALIASES=()declare -A BASH_CMDS=() You can also use this command to validate whether a variable has been set or not: if declare -p -A my_options > /dev/null 2>&1; then echo \"'my_options' exists\"else echo \"'my_options' does not exist\"fi We have to silence the error output of the declare command unless we want it to print an message if the variable doesn't exist.

A very common use for traps is to create a 'cleanup' function that is executed when the script exits or if the user aborts execution by pressing Ctrl+C (which sends the SIGINT signal). Here's an example of how a trap can be set to cleanup a temporary folder when a script exits or is interrupted: # Create a temporary folder for the effective shell download.source=\"https://effective-shell.com/downloads/effective-shell-samples.tar.gz\"tmp_dir=$(mktemp -d 2>/dev/null || mktemp -d -t 'effective-shell')tmp_tar=\"${tmp_dir}/effective-shell.tar.gz\"# Define a cleanup function that we will call when the script exits or if# it is aborted.cleanup () { if [ -e \"${tmp_tar}\" ]; then rm \"${tmp_tar}\"; fi if [ -d \"${tmp_dir}\" ]; then rm -rf \"${tmp_dir}\"; fi}# Cleanup on interrupt or terminate signals and on exit.trap \"cleanup\" INT TERM EXIT# Download the samples.curl --fail --compressed -q -s \"${source}\" -o \"${tmp_tar}\"# Extract the samples.tar -xzf \"${tmp_tar}\" -C \"${tmp_dir}\" In this script we have defined a function called 'cleanup'. We then use the trap command to ensure that we call the function if INT is sent, TERM is sent or when the script exits. This is very useful in scripts that can take a while. This script downloads the effective shell samples from the internet. If the user is having connectivity issues then this might take a while and they may end up aborting the script. If they do so in this case we will still clean up the temporary folder we created. Traps provide a very convenient way to handle things like cleanup, provide more diagnostic information or even disable a user from interrupting your script. In the example below we force the user to press Ctrl+C twice if they want to interrupt the script: interrupt_count=0on_interrupt() { if [ $interrupt_count -lt 1 ]; then echo \"Aborting this operation can cause errors.\" echo \"Press Ctrl+C again if you are sure you want to cancel.\" interrupt_count=$((interrupt_count + 1)) else # Convention is to use the status code 130 for interrupted scripts. echo \"Aborting long operation\" exit 130 fi}trap on_interrupt INTtotal_time=0while true; do echo \"Long operation: ${total_time} seconds elapsed\" sleep 3 total_time=$((total_time + 3))done If we run this script we can see that the user must press Ctrl+C twice to abort the operation: $ ~/effective-shell/scripts/long-operation.shLong operation: 0 seconds elapsedLong operation: 3 seconds elapsedLong operation: 6 seconds elapsed^CAborting this operation can cause errors.Press Ctrl+C again if you are sure you want to cancel.Long operation: 9 seconds elapsedLong operation: 12 seconds elapsed^CAborting long operation Some other things that you might want to be aware of for the trap command are: The SIG at the beginning of the name of a signal is optional but not supported in all shells, and a signal number can also be used - this means that SIGINT, INT and 2 are all equivalent options for trap, but INT is the most portable and easiest to read! You can list the signals available with trap -l or kill -l - but remember that special conditions such as EXIT and RETURN are not listed, you can find these with help trap You can stop a signal from being processed with trap \"\" INT - this means that no command will be executed when we receive a INT You can reset a trap by running trap - INT, this will remove any trap handler You can test your traps by sending a signal explicitly to your script with kill -s INT, providing the name of the signal","s":"Traps","u":"/part-4-shell-scripting/useful-patterns-for-shell-scripts","h":"#traps","p":573},{"i":586,"t":"You can use the getopts (parse option arguments) command to process the arguments for a script or function Let's imagine we wanted to update our 'common' command to support the following options: -h for 'help', which shows command help -e for 'execute', which takes the number of a command from the list which will be executed The 'getopts' command takes two parameters. The first is an 'option string', which is a list of the parameter letters that are allowed. The option string for 'getopts' expects that each letter followed by a colon represents an option that requires a value. The second parameter specifies the name of the variable that will be set to the currently processed option. If the option string starts with a colon, it affects how 'getopts' assigns values to the shell variables specified by 'name' and 'OPTARG'. For more detailed information, please refer to the 'man getopts' manual. Typically this command is used in a while loop, as it will return 'success' until the final option has been processed. A case statement is typically used to process the option: # Helper function to show how the command should be invoked.show_help() { echo \"usage:\" echo \" common [-h] [-e <command_number>] count\"}# Process the options.while getopts \":he:\" option; do case ${option} in # Handle the 'help' option. h ) show_help exit 0 ;; # Handle the 'execute command' option by storing the value provided # for the option. e ) execute_command=${OPTARG} ;; # If we have an invalid argument, warn and fail. \\? ) echo \"The value '${OPTARG}' is not a valid option\" exit 1 ;; # If we are missing a required argument, warn and exit. : ) echo \"The option '${OPTARG}' requires an argument\" ;; esacdone There are a few things to point out from this script: The option string starts with a colon - any option letter that is followed by a colon expects an argument If an invalid option letter is set, the value of the option variable is set to \\? - we can then handle this in our case statement If a letter is provided without an argument that is required, the value of the option variable is set to : - we can then handle this in our case statement For complex option processing you might see scripts where multiple loops are used to process sets of options. It is common to end option processing with the following line: shift $((OPTIND - 1)) The ${OPTIND} variable stores the index of the last option processed. By shifting by this value minus one, we remove the processed options from the $@ (all parameters) array. This means we don't try to process the same options again. The ~/effective-shell/scripts/common.sh script processes parameters using the getopts command. You can use this as an example to help you with your own scripts.","s":"Handling Options","u":"/part-4-shell-scripting/useful-patterns-for-shell-scripts","h":"#handling-options","p":573},{"i":588,"t":"There are special escape sequences that can be used in the shell to colour the output of the text shown. For example, in many terminals the following text will be shown in green: green='\\e[0;32m'reset='\\e[0m'echo -e \"Do you like ${green}apples${reset}?\" On most terminals you will see the text below, with the word 'apples' rendered in green: Do you like apples? Note that it is important to provide the -e flag to the 'echo' command so that it correctly processes the colour codes. In fact, a better option is to use the printf (format and print arguments) command, as it is more portable and behaves more consistently across different versions of Unix and Linux. The colour codes are ANSI escape sequences that have been defined to control the formatting of content in a terminal. There are number of formatting options - such as foreground and background colours, bold, underline and so on. These codes can be quickly found online if you search for \"ANSI color codes\". It is important to be careful when using colour codes - you don't want them in all circumstances. Let' see an example. The 'rainbow' function below writes out a message in a number of colours: rainbow () { local message=\"$1\" local reset='\\e[0m' for ((colour=31; colour<=37; colour++)) do colour_code=\"\\\\e[0;${colour}m\" printf \"${colour} - ${colour_code}${message}${reset}\\n\" done} If we run this function in most terminals, we'll see the provided message with the colour number in seven different colours: $ rainbow test31 - test32 - test33 - test34 - test35 - test36 - test37 - test We have to be careful when formatting output. It can be helpful for a user in an interactive shell (on many systems for example even the ls command is actually an alias for ls --color=auto meaning that the ls command uses colours in its output). But there are circumstance when we don't want to use colour codes. Let's see what we get when we write the rainbow output to a file: $ rainbow hello >> text.txt$ cat -v text.txt31 - ^[[0;31mhello^[[0m32 - ^[[0;32mhello^[[0m33 - ^[[0;33mhello^[[0m34 - ^[[0;34mhello^[[0m35 - ^[[0;35mhello^[[0m36 - ^[[0;36mhello^[[0m37 - ^[[0;37mhello^[[0m The '-v' parameter tells cat to make escape characters visible. If you open the in a text editor you will see the same escape characters written in the file. This shows the problem with the rainbow function - it adds the colour escape sequences even when we are writing the results to a file. In most cases this is not going to be what we want. Commands like ls do not include colour codes when writing to a file. There is not an entirely fool-proof way to avoid this issue, but the most common pattern I have seen is to check whether the standard output file descriptor is associated with a terminal. We can do this using the -t expression of the test command: if [ -t 1 ]; then echo \"We are writing to a terminal\"else echo \"We are not writing to a terminal\"fi You will see -t 1 in a number of scripts as a way to check whether the output is going to a terminal device. The -t test returns success if the provided file descriptor is associated with a terminal device. The file descriptor '1' is the descriptor for the stdout stream (if this is unfamiliar, check Chapter 7 - Thinking in Pipelines). Here's how we could use the test in our rainbow function: rainbow () { local message=\"$1\" local reset='\\e[0m' for ((colour=31; colour<=37; colour++)) do colour_code=\"\\\\e[0;${colour}m\" if [ -t 1 ]; then printf \"${colour} - ${colour_code}${message}${reset}\\n\" else printf \"${colour} - ${message}\\n\" fi done} This version of the function will not write the ANSI escape sequences if the output device is not a terminal, meaning that if we run: $ rainbow test > text.txt Then the output file will not contain escape sequences. You can find out more about the -t test by running man test. As a final tip - if you are formatting output you should consider using the tput (query terminfo database) command to make your code more readable and portable: green=$(tput setaf 2) # set ansi foreground to '2' (green)reset=$(tput sgr0) # reset the coloursecho -e \"Do you like ${green}apples${reset}?\" The 'tput' command is quite advanced, but you can search online for more details (the manual pages for the command are hard to decipher as it can be used for many operations and is complex).

The first is that pattern requires that you know the path to the shell.

For example, on some Unix systems the following shebang will run bash with the -e parameter: #!/usr/bin/env bash -e However, on many Unix distributions only one parameter is passed.

Shell scripts are great for automating simple tasks, creating utilities to help you out, but come with many challenges. The syntax can be confusing, making scripts work across multiple systems can be challenging, and there are not many features to help you write robust code. Perhaps the biggest anti-pattern in shell scripts is to simply let them get too large and do too much with them. There comes a certain point where you will almost certainly create a more portable, performant and maintainable solution to your problem using a dedicated programming language like Python (which is available on almost all systems) or one of the many other languages available. This is a topic we discuss in detail in the Chapter 30 - How to Avoid Scripting, but for now I would just say that as soon as your script starts to get longer than a page, or takes more than a few minutes to reason about, then you might be reaching the point that a programming language could be a better option.","s":"Complex Logic in Shell Scripts","u":"/part-4-shell-scripting/useful-patterns-for-shell-scripts","h":"#complex-logic-in-shell-scripts","p":573},{"i":604,"t":"You might find shell scripts that do not have a shebang at the top. This is something that you should avoid. The shebang gives you a way to be very explicit about what shell is required to run your script. For example, if I see a shebang like this: #!/usr/bin/env sh Then my assumption would be that this script can run on any Posix compliant shell, i.e. it is as compatible as possible. However, if I see this: #!/usr/bin/env bash Then the assumption would be that this script is Bash-specific and uses \"Bash-isms\", such as the if [[ conditional ]] construct. Finally, if I was to see a shebang like this: #!/usr/bin/env zsh Then I would expect that this script has been explicitly written to be used with Z-Shell. If you do not include a shebang in a script, then the behaviour can be ambiguous. For example, at the time of writing, if you run a shell script without a shebang from a Bash shell, then the script will be run using a new instance of Bash. However, if you run a shell script without a shebang from Z-Shell then Z-Shell will use sh from your path. But depending on your system, sh may be a symlink to dash, or bash, or another shell. Scripts that do not have shebangs are inherently ambiguous and will run using different shells depending on the shell used to execute the script as well as the operating system. If you want to experiment and see what shell runs a script, create a script such as the ~/effective-shell/scripts/nobang.sh script that looks like this: # nobang: This script shows an anti-pattern - not using a shebang in a shell# script. It shows the process tree to for the shell that runs the script:pstree $$ If I run this script from MacOS, the output below is shown: -+= 00001 root /sbin/launchd \\-+= 07995 dwmkerr tmux \\-+= 31195 dwmkerr /bin/zsh \\-+= 49833 dwmkerr sh ./samples/script/nobang.sh \\-+- 49834 dwmkerr pstree -p 49833 \\--- 49835 root ps -axwwo user,pid,ppid,pgid,command Although I ran the script from a Z-Shell session, it was executed with sh, which is the Bourne Shell (version 3 on my system).

However, the file we will use most often is the ~/.bashrc file. When you log into a machine using the shell, or start a shell program in a terminal emulator like the Gnome Terminal or Konsole, you are running an interactive shell. An interactive shell is one that is connected to your keyboard and screen. When an interactive shell starts, one of the operations it performs is to run all of the commands in the file ~/.bashrc. This is one of the 'shell startup' files. The 'RC' in the file name stands for 'run commands' (sometimes people will also refer to this as 'run configuration'). This is a convention from the early days of Unix. Many tools on Unix and Linux have files that end in 'rc' that are loaded when a program starts up. For example, the ~/.vimrc run commands file is loaded by the vim program when it starts. The ~/.bashrc file is in your home directory - this means that it is your personal Bash configuration file. There is also a file that is normally at /etc/bash.bashrc that is used to configure Bash for all users. Again - this is a common convention for Unix and Linux systems - there is a 'global' configuration file that is used for all users, as well as a 'user' configuration file in the user's home directory that the user can edit to personalise things for themselves. Z-Shell The zsh shell uses a ~/.zshrc file for per-user configuration and /etc/zsh/zshrc for global configuration. The paths are different but the concepts are the same. Other shells may use different paths as well - you should be able to find the paths in their manual pages.","s":"The Shell Configuration File","u":"/part-5-building-your-toolkit/configuring-the-shell","h":"#the-shell-configuration-file","p":607},{"i":612,"t":"Let's take a look at some of the commands that are in the ~/.bashrc on a clean Ubuntu 20 installation (if you want to know how to set up a free Ubuntu 20 machine check Appendix - Setting Up a Linux Virtual Machine.

It's very important to understand that this file is sourced by the shell - so we have to use return if we want to stop processing it. If we used exit instead then the shell would close, which is definitely not what we want! If you need a reminder on sourcing, check Chapter 18 - Shell Script Essentials. The next section of the file sets up some of the configuration for the history features of the shell. Some variables are set, such as HISTSIZE (the number of commands to store in the history), we also set some options using the shopt (set shell option flag). Later on, we can see that some aliases are defined, for user convenience. For example, the la alias is a shorthand for ls -A, which can save a few keystrokes. This exactly the sort of configuration that makes sense to keep in the ~/.bashrc file. Users can modify this to suit their preferences. Now let's look at some of the common features you might configure in the ~/.bashrc file.","s":"The Default Configuration File","u":"/part-5-building-your-toolkit/configuring-the-shell","h":"#the-default-configuration-file","p":607},{"i":614,"t":"You can add any commands you like to the ~/.bashrc file, these commands will be run when the shell starts up. Let's see a few examples of what you might add to your ~/.bashrc. Aliases​ If you find yourself typing the same series of keystrokes again and again, you might want to add some aliases to your configuration file: # Start a web serveralias serve=\"python3 -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000\"# Open vim without loading the vimrc.alias vimnilla='vi -u NONE'# Shortcut for 'kubectl', saves a lot of time!alias k='kubectl'# Quickly go to my GitHub repositories.alias gocode='cd ~/repos/github/dwmkerr' If you are not familiar with aliases, check Chapter 10 - Understanding Commands. You might also use aliases to change the behaviour of existing commands. For example, we can change the rm command to automatically ask for confirmation before a file is deleted: # Always run 'rm' in interactive mode.alias rm='rm -i' Be aware that the more you customise default commands the more that you run the risk that tutorials or samples you use may not work as expected, as those samples will expect the default behaviour of the command. Functions​ If you have more complex operations that you regularly perform, you could add them to your ~/.bashrc as a function: # Restart the shell.restart-shell() { exec -l $SHELL}# Make a directory (don't fail if it exists) and move into it in one line.function mkd { mkdir -p -- \"$1\" && cd -P -- \"$1\";}# Cut, but in reverse, e.g:# $ echo \"One;Two;Three;Four;Five\" | revcut -d';' -f2# -> Fourfunction revcut { rev | cut \"$@\" | rev} You can find out more about functions in Chapter 22 - Functions, Parameters and Error Handling. Shell Options​ The ~/.bashrc file is the ideal place to configure shell options to suit your preferences: # If we enter a directory name on its own, assume we want to 'cd' into it.shopt -s autocd In this example we use the shopt (set shell option) command to set the autocd option. This option allows you to enter the name of a directory as if it was a command, when you press 'enter' the shell will cd into the directory. You can set an option using the -s (set option) flag and unset an option with the -u (unset option) flag. You can list the options available to set by running shopt -p, or searching the man bash page for shopt. Some of the most useful options are: Option Description autocd Enter a directory name as a command and the shell will cd to it. cdable_vars Allows you to cd into a variable, such as repos=~/repos; cd repos cdspell The shell will try to fix typos to the cd command. checkjobs Show the status of stopped and running jobs before exiting the shell. cmdhist Save multi-line commands in the shell history as single entries, rather than an entry per line. dirspell Try to correct typos when auto-completing directory names. globstar Support recursive globbing such as **/*.py to find files in subdirectories. histappend Append to the history file when the shell exists, rather than overwriting it. As well as the options that can be set using the shopt command, there are also many variables that are used to configure the shell. We've seen some of these variables already, such as the EDITOR variable that defines what text editor to use and the PAGER variable that defines what pager program to use. Changing the Command Prompt​ The command prompt is the information that is shown to the left of the caret in the shell where you enter commands. It will often look something like this: dwmkerr@ip-172-31-28-144:~/effective-shell$ This command prompt in this example is made up of the following parts: ubuntu - the name of the current user ip-172-31-28-144 - the hostname of the machine ~/effective-shell - the current directory $ - an indicator showing that we are using Bash (this will be # if we are a super user) The structure and format of the command prompt can be configured using the PS1 variable. This is a large enough topic that the whole of the next chapter is dedicated to customising the command prompt. Source Files​ Another common pattern for the ~/.bashrc file is to simply source another file. For example, you might want to create a set of common functions that you keep in a file called shell-functions.sh. You could source this file as part of your shell configuration: # Load my common shell functions.source ~/shell-functions.sh In fact, a lot of the shell startup files do exactly this. For example, in the default ~/.bashrc file on Ubuntu 20, you will see these lines: if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then . ~/.bash_aliasesfi This line uses the -f test to see whether a file named ~/.bash_aliases exists. If it does, it is loaded (using dot sourcing as the notation). There are lots of different ways to manage your shell configuration. This can range from the simple, such as adding an alias to the ~/.bashrc file, to the complex, such as sourcing the contents of an entire directory, or configuring a shell dynamically based on what tools are installed on a system. Configure Your System​ You might have particular commands you want to ensure are run when you start a shell. For example, let's say that you want to always have a folder named ~/today that links to a temporary folder which is updated daily. To do this, you could add the following commands to the ~/.bashrc file: # Get today's date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.today=$(date +\"%Y-%m-%d\")# Create the path to today's temp folder and then make sure the folder exists.temp_path=\"/tmp/${today}\"mkdir -p \"${temp_path}\"# Now that we've created the folder, make a symlink to it in our homedir.ln -sf \"${temp_path}\" \"${HOME}/today\" If I add this code to my ~/.bashrc file then whenever I start a new shell, a folder will be created with today's date in the /tmp/ directory, and a link will be created to this folder at ~/today. This provides a convenient way to have a temporary working folder for the day. You can then go back and refer to old temporary folders if you need to. Configuration Tips​ There are a few things that you should pay attention to when working with startup files. Do not print output It is considered bad practice to print output during startup of the shell. Avoid running commands like echo or printf. If you call commands that write to stdout then silence the output by piping it to /dev/null. Do not run long operations You might have written a cool scripts that pulls down information on stocks or weather from a website, ready to show in your shell. But avoid running anything in a startup file that can take a lot of time. Every time you start your shell you'll have a delay while the command runs and this can really slow you down! Be careful not to break things Don't run so many commands that you might cause errors or failures on startup. This can make your shell difficult to use or slow to start up. If your startup logic is failing it can be hard to debug, so try not to make it too complex! Clean up after yourself! Remember, any variables you set will be set for all shells that read the startup file. If there are variables that you only need during the processing of the file, consider using the unset command to unset the variable at the end of startup. Expect commands to be run multiple times Write your startup files with the assumption that they will be run multiple times. If you start a new shell from your current shell, your configuration file will be loaded again. Your configuration should not cause errors if it is run multiple times!","s":"Common Shell Configurations","u":"/part-5-building-your-toolkit/configuring-the-shell","h":"#common-shell-configurations","p":607},{"i":616,"t":"In most cases you will only need to work with the ~/.bashrc file to configure your shell. However, the shell actually uses a number of different configuration files (which are called 'startup files') depending on how the shell is being used. You may have seen references to files such as /etc/profile, ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_logout and more. The different files that are used can be quite confusing. For the rest of this chapter we're going to go into the details of exactly how the shell uses these different files.","s":"Shell Startup","u":"/part-5-building-your-toolkit/configuring-the-shell","h":"#shell-startup","p":607},{"i":618,"t":"For us to be able to understand how shells are configured, we need to understand the different types of shells that can run. This does not mean different shell programs, such as bash, zsh or dash, but instead the differences between interactive and non-interactive shells, as well as login shells. A lot of people get confused by how the shell is configured because they don't fully understand what these different types of shells are. So let's introduce each one, what it is and how it is used.","s":"Different Types of Shells","u":"/part-5-building-your-toolkit/configuring-the-shell","h":"#different-types-of-shells","p":607},{"i":620,"t":"An interactive shell is any shell that has its input, output and error standard streams connected to a terminal. This sounds complicated, but it really just means that an interactive shell is one that you interact with via the keyboard and display!

The most common example we've seen so far for non interactive shells are the shells that run shell scripts! Let's run the showpstree.sh script from the samples to show the process tree for the current process. This script shows the process tree for the shell process it is running in and looks like this: # GNU pstree; use the long form (-l) show the command line (-a) and the# details for a specific process (-s).pstree -a -s $$ Here's the output when we run this script: ~$ ./effective-shell/scripts/showpstree.shsystemd └─sshd └─sshd └─sshd └─bash └─sh ./effective-shell/scripts/showpstree.sh └─pstree -a -s 1675 The output will look different depending on what system you are using, but the key section to focus on are the final three processes: pstree -a -s 1675 - this is just the pstree (show process tree) command that is run in the showpstree.sh script sh ./effective-shell/scripts/showpstree.sh - this is a non-interactive shell that is running our shell script bash - this is the interactive shell that we used to invoke our shell script When you run a shell script, it runs in a non-interactive shell. This is really important to remember! Shell scripts are run in non-interactive shells. This means that anything you define in ~/.bashrc will not be loaded, so don't try and use aliases or other customisations that you have made. In fact, on many distributions you will see the following lines in the default ~/.bashrc: # If not running interactively, don't do anythingcase $- in *i*) ;; *) return;;esac The first section of the script checks the current shell parameters (which are stored in the special $- variable) to see whether the i (interactive) parameter is present. If it is not present, the return command runs. This check for the shell parameters ensures that even if a non-interactive shell does load the run commands file for some reason, it stops reading it right away. If you need a refresher on how the case statement works, check Chapter 20 - Mastering Conditional Logic. Another way to show a non-interactive shell in action is to simply invoke the shell program with a specified command from the command like: $ sh -c \"echo $((5 + 5))\"10 In this example we started the sh (shell) program and provided a command via the -c (command) flag. This starts a non-interactive shell. Why do non-interactive shells not load the configuration file? There are two reasons. The first is that it doesn't make sense for scripts to rely on user-level customisations. If one user has an alias and refers to it in a script, then the script will not run for another user unless they have the same alias. The second reason is for performance - when using a shell to run a script the shell can start much more quickly if it doesn't need to load configuration or customisations.","s":"Non-Interactive Shells","u":"/part-5-building-your-toolkit/configuring-the-shell","h":"#non-interactive-shells","p":607},{"i":624,"t":"When you login to a computer with a shell, entering credentials such as a username and password, then you are using a login shell. A login shell will normally run some initial setup of your environment and provide the bare minimum configuration required to work with the system. For example, most shells set up the $PATH variable as part of the initialisation of the login shell. For systems that don't have a graphical interface, any shell you create will be a child of the login shell, so will inherit the login shell's configuration. For graphical interfaces to systems, such as KDE or Gnome, when you log in with the graphical interface, the desktop manager normally configures the environment using the same configuration as is used for a login shell. The desktop manager process will therefore have variables like the $PATH set up just as if you had logged in at the command line. When you ssh onto a remote machine, you will be running a login shell. In most cases, when you switch users with commands like su (set user), you will start a login shell as well1. The key thing to remember about login shells is that they are normally run once, when you start working with a computer, and all of the other shells you then run will be children of the login shell. You can see whether your shell is a login shell by examining the $0 variable. This variable holds the parameters that were provided to start the shell. By convention, if the parameter starts with a - dash symbol, you can assume that you are in a login shell. Let's see an example of this in action by logging into a virtual machine (if you would like to set up your own Linux virtual machine you can follow the guide in Appendix - Setting Up a Linux Virtual Machine: $ ssh effective-shell-ubuntu-20Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-1045-aws x86_64)...To run a command as administrator (user \"root\"), use \"sudo <command>\".See \"man sudo_root\" for details.~$ echo \"$0\"-bash Here we can see that the parameter that the shell was started with was -bash. This starts with a - dash symbol, indicating that it is a login shell. Login shells are normally interactive shells, but it is possible to run a non-interactive login shell (it's just quite an unusual thing to do). In the early days of Unix, executing any commands could be time consuming. The login shell would perform the most essential configuration only once when a user logs in and all subsequent shell processes could start more quickly as they would inherit the login configuration and then load the user specific configuration.","s":"Login Shells","u":"/part-5-building-your-toolkit/configuring-the-shell","h":"#login-shells","p":607},{"i":626,"t":"When the shell starts, it reads a set of startup files. These files are shell scripts that are sourced by the shell. A script that is sourced is loaded into the current shell process, rather than running in a new shell process. For many people, the various different files that are loaded can cause confusion. But as long as you understand the different types of shells that exist, it is actually quite straightforward to understand the process. When a login shell starts, the following steps are taken: The shell attempts to load the profile file The profile file will normally load the run commands file When an interactive shell starts, the following steps are taken: The shell attempts to load the run commands file When a non-interactive shell starts, it doesn't load any configuration files, unless one has been specified in the BASH_ENV variable.

The profile file contains the most essential configuration that is required. It is often used to set things like the $PATH environment variable, which will sometimes have different values depending on the operating system you are using. The shell will then attempt to read each of the following files. If the shell finds one that is readable, it reads it and executes its commands, and then does not attempt to read the others: ~/.bash_profile ~/.bash_login ~/.profile There are very few circumstances in which you should change any of these files. It is based to think of the profile files as essential operating system specific configuration that is needed to have a functional login shell. When a login shell closes, it will run any commands in the ~/.bash_logout file. However, users might terminate the shell process forcibly, which means that you cannot be sure this file will always be sourced as the shell exits. The configuration that the startup files perform varies from distribution to distribution, but in general they will do at least the following: Set the $PATH variable to include the appropriate folders for tools for your distribution Set the shell prompt, the characters that are shown to the user to show they need to enter input (such as ~$ when we are in the home folder, or ~# if we are in the home folder as a super user) Set up auto-completion (the feature that allows you to press 'tab' to see suggestions when entering commands) Load the run commands file - we'll look at this file next The key thing to remember about the profile files is that you normally don't need to change them and they normally load the run command file for you.","s":"The Shell Profile File","u":"/part-5-building-your-toolkit/configuring-the-shell","h":"#the-shell-profile-fileindex","p":607},{"i":630,"t":"When an interactive non-login shell is started, the shell loads and executes the commands from the /etc/bash.bashrc file and then the ~/.bashrc file (if they exist).

The ~/.bashrc file is where you can put your own commands to configure the shell to suit how you want to use it.

This means that when you open a terminal program use as the Gnome Terminal or Konsole, the shell is a child of a process which has loaded the profile. Even if you don't use a login shell to access a system, you can normally be sure that the profile will have been loaded by the desktop manager. Different distributions and operating systems may handle this in slightly different ways. For example, on MacOS when you run the Terminal program it actually starts a login shell2.

The final item on a line is the shell that is used for the user. When a user logs in, their shell is set in the SHELL environment variable, we can write this value out with the echo command: $ echo \"My shell is: $SHELL\"My shell is: /bin/bash There are a few ways that you can change your shell. However, before you change your shell, you need to make sure that the shell you want to use is listed in the 'available shells' file. This file is kept at /etc/shells: $ cat /etc/shells# /etc/shells: valid login shells/bin/sh/bin/bash/usr/bin/bash/bin/rbash/usr/bin/rbash/bin/dash/usr/bin/dash/usr/bin/tmux If the shell you want to use is not listed in /etc/shells you will need to add it to the list. Once you have installed the shell you want to use and added it to the /etc/shells list you can run the chsh (change shell) command to change the shell for a given user: $ chsh -s /bin/sh dwmkerr The -s (shell) parameter is used to specify the shell path. After this we provide the name of the user we are changing the shell for. On many systems users are allowed to change their own shell as long as it is in the /etc/shells list. To change the shell for another user, or to use a shell that is not in the /etc/shells list the chsh command will need to be run as a super-user. You can also change the shell for a user by editing the /etc/passwd file. Changing your shell is an advanced topic - if you prefer to use another shell you could also simply start the shell from your login shell, for example by running sh from your Bash shell session. As an end-to-end example, here's how you would install zsh and set it for the current user on a Debian based system: # Elevate privileges to super-user.sudo su# Update the apt databases and install 'zsh'.apt update -yapt install zsh# Add 'zsh' to the list of shell.echo \"/bin/zsh\" >> /etc/shells# Return to normal user mode.exit# Change the current user's shell to 'zsh'.chsh -s \"/bin/zsh\" $USER Be careful when changing your shell - if you get this wrong then you may inadvertently lock yourself out of your account, if logging in tries to start a shell that is not properly configured.

The if statement has the following structure: if <test-commands>then <conditional-command 1> <conditional-command 2> <conditional-command n>fi The if statement will run the 'test commands'. If the result of the commands are all zero (which means 'success'), then each of the 'conditional' commands will be run. We 'close' the if statement with the fi keyword, which is if written backwards. Let's see how the if statement is used with a simple example. We will try and create a folder using mkdir. The mkdir command will return zero if the folder is created successfully: if mkdir ~/backupsthen echo \"Successfully created the 'backups' folder\"fi If you don't have a folder called backups in your home directory then the command will run successfully. The mkdir command will return zero and the conditional statements will be run and you will see the output below: Successfully created the 'backups' folder If you then run the script again, the mkdir command will fail. In this case it does not return zero and the conditional commands are not executed. We will see an error message from the mkdir command: mkdir: /home/dwmkerr/backups: File exists This is the basics of how the if statement works. We provide test commands, if the test commands succeed, a set of conditional commands are then executed. You might be surprised to hear that the result of the test commands has to be zero for the conditional commands to run. This is the opposite of how most programming languages work - normally zero would be considered 'false'. The reason for this - is that for computer programs that run, 'zero' generally means success. Any non-zero value is typically used to indicate an error code. So whilst inside a programming language, an if statement will check for a value to be 'true', just remember that in the shell an if statement will check for a command to be successful.","s":"The If Statement","u":"/part-4-shell-scripting/mastering-conditional-logic","h":"#the-if-statement-index-","p":639},{"i":644,"t":"The test (evaluate expression) command is used to check whether a certain condition is true or not.

We could improve our earlier if statement example by only creating the 'backups' folder if it doesn't already exist, using the test command: if ! test -d ~/backupsthen echo \"Creating backups folder\" mkdir ~/backupsfi The test command evaluates an expression. In this case the expression is: -d ~/backups This expression uses the -d (file exists and is a directory) operator to check if the provided path is a directory. We want to create the directory only if it doesn't exist, so we use the 'not' operator to 'invert' the result of test. The 'not' operator is written with the ! exclamation point symbol. You can surround an expression with square bracket and the shell will evaluate the expression with the test command. This can make your scripts far more compact: if !

[ -d ~/backups ]; then mkdir ~/backupsfi The shell assumes that each individual line is a single statement. If you want to put more than one statement on a line then you need to let the shell know when one statement ends and another starts. We can use a semi-colon for this. The shell uses the semi-colon as a 'command separator' symbol. If you don't include a semi-colon at the end of a command then the shell assumes that the entire line is a single statement. If you try and run the script without the semi-colon you will get an error: bash: syntax error near unexpected token `fi' I would suggest you start by writing your if statements with the if and the then on separate lines. Once you are more familiar with the syntax, you can start to combine the lines if you prefer. You can put as many statements on a single line as you like - you could even write the script like so: if ! test -d ~/backups; then mkdir ~/backups; fi The then doesn't require a semi-colon as it is a keyword rather than a command.

The 'common' command is the command we created in Chapter 18 - Shell Script Essentials. Now if you run the script and you don't have the 'common' command installed you will see the following output: The 'common' command has not been installed in the local bin folder.

If you want to see each of the different messages, you might find the following snippets useful to add or remove the command or change its executable permissions: ln -s $HOME/effective-shell/scripts/common.v1.sh /usr/local/bin/common - Create a link to the 'common' command in the local binaries folder chmod -x $HOME/effective-shell/scripts/common.v1.sh remove the 'executable' flag from the 'common' command, making it not executable chmod +x $HOME/effective-shell/scripts/common.v1.sh add the 'executable' flag from the 'common' command, making it executable rm /usr/local/bin/common remove the link to the 'common' command from the local binaries folder The elif statement looks very similar to the if statement. The statement takes a set of commands. These commands could be normal shell commands, test commands, or test commands written with the square brackets short-hand notation. It is very important to think about the order in which the if and elif statement are executed. If we had written the script like this, it would not work: if [ -e /usr/local/bin/common ]; then echo \"The 'common' command has been installed and is executable.\"elif [ -x /usr/local/bin/common ]; then echo \"The 'common' command has been installed and is not executable.\"else echo \"The 'common' command has not been installed.\"fi In this script we check to see if the file exists first. If the file exists then the condition -e operator will return true, and we will not run the check in the elif statement. This means we'll never successfully evaluate the statements in the elif block (because for the file to be executable it must exist, so the first condition in the if statement will always take precedence.

You can use 'and' or 'or' in a single test statement by using the special -a (and) and -o (or) operators. This is how the script would look using the -a operator: if [ $year -ge 1980 -a $year -lt 1990 ]; then echo \"$year is in the 1980s\"fi These operators can lead to some subtle problems so I would not recommend that you use them.

Conditional expressions use two square brackets rather than one: if [[ $year -ge 1980 && $year -lt 1990 ]]; then echo \"$year is in the 1980s\"fi Conditional expressions have a number of benefits over plain test commands. Some of the most important ones are: You can use the && and || operators directly in the expression If you use an || expression and the left hand side of the expression is true, the right hand side will not be evaluated - this is not always the case with older versions of Bash when using the -o operator (this is a subtle difference but can help avoid potentially incorrect behaviour) Numbers are correctly compared even if they are in different formats (for example, you can compare hexadecimal and octal numbers, this does not work in the standard test expression) You can use the incredibly useful =~ operator to use a regular expression in your condition (we'll look at this next) You can find more details on conditional expressions by using man bash and searching for \\[\\[ (this is the double square brackets with each one escaped with a backslash). Some people prefer to use single brackets so that their script is more portable, as the double brackets are specific to Bash and Bash-like shells. Others prefer to use the double brackets so that they can use the additional features offered. Whether you use single or double brackets will partly be down to preference and whether it is more important in your use case to have portability or whether it is more important to have the more 'correct' behaviour.","s":"Conditional Expressions","u":"/part-4-shell-scripting/mastering-conditional-logic","h":"#conditional-expressions","p":639},{"i":660,"t":"When you use the double square brackets conditional expression syntax you can use the =~ operator to test for a regular expression. This can be extremely useful. If you need a reminder on how regular expressions work check Chapter 13 - Regex Essentials.

You can use capture groups in your regular expression to help you extract text. For example, we could get the name of the current shell binary with the code below: shell_regex=\"([^/]+)$\"if [[ $SHELL =~ $shell_regex ]]; then echo \"Your shell binary is: ${BASH_REMATCH[1]}\"else echo \"Unable to extract your shell binary\"fi On my machine this script shows the following output: Your shell binary is: bash The $BASH_REMATCH variable is an array - the first result value in the array is the entire match, each subsequent value in the array is the result of each capture group in the expression.

Let's take a look at how this would work: mkdir -p ~/backups && cd ~/backups In this case we have chained two commands together using the && operator. The shell will only run the second command if the first command succeeds. It evaluates the result of the first command - if it is successful, then it evaluates the second command. It does this because we are trying to evaluate the combination of both commands. Or, if we were to write this in pseudo-code: does (command1 and command2) succeed? If command fails, the shell doesn't need to evaluate the second command - the overall result must be false, as the first command has already failed. Contrast this to the || operator: [ -d ~/backups ] || mkdir ~/backups In this case we evaluate the second command only if the first command fails. Let's look at the pseudo code: does (command1 or command2) succeed? If the first command succeeds, the shell doesn't need to evaluate the second command. However, if the first command fails, the shell does have to evaluate the second command, to see if either of them succeed. In summary, here's how command chaining works: # Run command1, if it succeeds run command2.command1 && command2# Run command1, if it does not succeed run command2.command1 || command2 You will see this syntax a lot in shell scrips as it is very succinct. It can also be very useful when using the shell interactively. For example, it is almost second nature for me to write the following commands: make build && make deploy Here I am using the make (build programs) command. If the 'build' step for a project succeeds, I want to run the 'deploy' step. But I don't want to run the 'deploy' step if the 'build' step fails!","s":"Chaining Commands","u":"/part-4-shell-scripting/mastering-conditional-logic","h":"#chaining-commands","p":639},{"i":664,"t":"If you find yourself writing overly complex 'if statements', you might use a case statement to simplify your code.

Here's a common example you'll see - checking to see whether a response is 'yes' or 'no': read -p \"Yes or no: \" responsecase \"${response}\" in y | Y | yes | ok) echo \"You have confirmed\" ;; n | N | no) echo \"You have denied\" ;; *) echo \"'${response}' is not a valid response\" ;;esac The example above shows very simple text patterns, but any text pattern can be used: read -p \"Yes or no: \" responsecase \"${response}\" in [yY]*) echo \"You have (probably) confirmed\" ;; [nN]*) echo \"You have (probably) denied\" ;; *) echo \"'${response}' is not a valid response\" ;;esac In this example the first pattern is [yY]* which means either the 'y' or 'Y' character followed by zero or more characters, this will match things like 'yes' 'YES' or 'yay'. We have a similar pattern for the negative response. The case statement can look quite complex, I often think that even if it takes more lines to write the logic using 'if statements' it will be more readable, but this is common pattern nonetheless and good to know about!","s":"Case Statements","u":"/part-4-shell-scripting/mastering-conditional-logic","h":"#case-statements","p":639},{"i":666,"t":"Now that we know how to use if statements, we can update the 'common' command that we have been improving as part of each chapter.

If we can, we store the name of the shell binary and its associated history in a pair of variables. Then when we come to actually search through the history, we check the shell binary. If it is bash, we run the same command as before. If it is zsh we run a similar command, but account for the fact that the Z-Shell history file has some extra content which needs to be removed. Note that as well as showing how to use more variables and if statements, as well as nested if statements (when one if statement is inside another) we can also see that we have very descriptive comments. Each comment is giving clear information on what we are trying to accomplish, which should make the script easier to maintain.

The repository's files are stored on your local machine in a folder named .git in the location where you initialised the repository. A remote is a repository that is on another machine. You can push and pull your changes to and from a remote repository as a way to back-up your repository. You can share this remote with other people so that they can collaborate on it, or download it to other machines you work on. There are a number of services you can use that allow you to host public repositories (which can be seen by anyone) and private repositories (which have more restricted access). To see how remotes work I will show how to create a repository using the popular GitHub service. GitHub is free for individuals and is an extremely popular Git provider and online collaboration platform. To create a remote, you will first need to sign-up for a GitHub account. When you have done that you will be offered the option to create a repository: Choose the 'Create a repository' option. You will then be asked to provide a name for your repository. I'm going to use this repository to host my dotfiles, so I have chosen \"dotfiles\": If you don't want members of the public to be able to see your repository, choose the 'private' option. If you already have a local repository then don't check any of the boxes under \"Initialise this repository with\" - we want to create an empty repository which we will then 'push' our changes to.

The -u flag is used to track changes - we'll see what this means shortly. At this stage if you refresh your browser you'll see your dotfiles repository, with all of our changes we've made so far! Each of the files and folders we have created is shown, we can view any of the files, look at the commit history, see the log messages and more.

If your repository is private you will have to authenticate to be able to do this, but if your repository is public then you (or anyone else) can download your dotfiles. Hosting your dotfiles on GitHub is a very convenient way of making your dotfiles accessible anywhere. With a single command you can download them to any machine, and then run the install.sh script from the dotfiles folder to setup the shell startup files.

They are not actually Git features, but have become so widely used that you are likely to come across the terminology when working with online Git repositories. A fork is a copy of a Git repository. Typically you will fork a repository if you want to take a copy of someone else's code and work on it yourself. I have created a simple dotfiles repository on GitHub that you can use as a starting point for your own dotfile configuration. Let's use this to see how forking works. First, we open up the GitHub project that we'd like to fork, which in this case is at www.github.com/effective-shell/dotfiles. Notice that there is a 'Fork' option on the top-right of the screen: Choose the 'fork' option and GitHub will create a copy of the repository in your own account. You can now clone this repository, make changes and work on it as if it was your own. The original repository is tracked by GitHub, meaning that you can update from it at any time. If you have made changes to a fork, you can then open a Pull Request. A pull request is a request to merge a set of changes from one branch into another, or from one fork into the original repository. So if you were to improve upon the dotfiles that you forked, and wanted to share your changes back, you could open a pull request to do so. Typically when a pull request is opened, the project maintainer will then review the changes, make suggestions or discuss the proposal, and then either merge the pull request or reject it. In the screenshot below I am opening a pull request from my clone of the dotfiles repository to the original dotfiles repository, this pull requests adds an uninstall script to the repository. A maintainer of the target repository will then review the changes: This model of forking and pull requests is really just a nice user interface on top of the underlying capabilities Git has to track remotes and manage branches. Services like GitHub offer functionality to discuss changes, run arbitrary pipelines project maintainers might create to test the code and so on. GitHub has become a remarkably popular site for people to collaborate on projects together. At the time of writing the microsoft/vscode repository, which is the popular Visual Studio Code open-source editor, has had contributions from more than 19,000 individual contributors!","s":"Forking and Pull Requests","u":"/part-5-building-your-toolkit/managing-rempte-git-repositories/","h":"#forking-and-pull-requests","p":669},{"i":684,"t":"When you push a branch to a remote on GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket and a number of other Git services providers, a message is shown in the command prompt with a link to open a Pull Request: $ git push -u origin fix/fix-shell-configuration...remote:remote: Create a pull request for 'fix/fix-shell-configuration' on GitHub by visiting:remote: https://github.com/dwmkerr/dotfiles/pull/new/fix/fix-shell-configuration... We can write a shell function that runs the git push command, reads its output, and then if it finds a web address, open it in a browser. In fact, the dotfiles repository at github.com/effective-shell/dotfiles has exactly this function - just run the command gpr to open a pull request! This function is actually quite straightforward - the code for it is below (with some of the comments and code to colour the output removed for legibility): gpr() { # Get the current branch name, or use 'HEAD' if we cannot get it. branch=$(git symbolic-ref -q HEAD) branch=${branch##refs/heads/} branch=${branch:-HEAD} # Pushing take a little while, so let the user know we're working. printf \"Opening pull request for ${branch}...\\n\" # Push to origin, grabbing the output but then echoing it back. push_output=`git push origin -u ${branch} 2>&1` printf \"\\n${push_output}\" # If there's anything which starts with http, it's a good guess it'll be a # link to GitHub/GitLab/Whatever.

When then run the git push origin command, and record the output of the command into a variable. Once the push command has completed, we write its output to the screen, and search for the first hyperlink, using grep and sed, then use python to open the link in a browser. I use the gpr function many times per day and it has been a real time-saver!","s":"A Script to Open a Pull Request","u":"/part-5-building-your-toolkit/managing-rempte-git-repositories/","h":"#a-script-to-open-a-pull-request","p":669},{"i":686,"t":"In Chapter 26 - Customising Your Command Prompt we saw how to customise the command prompt by setting the PS1 variable. As you start using Git more you might find it convenient to show some information about the repository in your prompt. As an example, while I am writing this chapter, my command prompt looks like this: github/dwmkerr/effective-shell feat/managing-git-remotes ! 1 in stash$ This is easier to see in the screenshot below as it shows the colour: I spread my prompt over two lines and leave the prompt indicator as the only thing on the line where I type. This means my cursor does not become too indented. My command prompt shows the following information: Content Description github/dwmkerr/effective-shell My current folder, and up to two parent folders. feat/managing-git-remotes My current Git branch, if I am in a Git repository. ! A red exclamation mark is shown if I have uncommitted changes. 1 in stash If I have anything in my Git stash, a message is shown in amber. You can try out this style of command prompt by calling the set_ps1 function: source ~/dotfiles/shell.d/set_ps1.shset_ps1 dwmkerr If you want to change back to your previous prompt, just run set_ps1 again without any parameters. If you are interested in showing Git information in your command prompt you can take a look at the set_ps1.sh file to see the full details. We'll take a look at a snippet as it is interesting to see how to get this Git information. _git_info() { # Don't write anything if we're not in a folder tracked by git. if !

If we are not in a Git working tree, we don't show anything. Get the current branch name with git branch --show-current). Check to see if there are any changes by looking at git status. The --porcelain=v1 line ensures that the status is machine-readable (this is easier to work with when scripting). Check the number of 'stash' revisions. Don't worry about stashes for now or the git rev-list command - these are more advanced features. The rest of the script is formatting only - underlining the branch name if it is the main branch, showing the exclamation mark if we have changes and so on. You can take the script as a starting point for your own customisations for the command prompt if you will be using Git a lot!","s":"Showing Git Information in the Command Prompt","u":"/part-5-building-your-toolkit/managing-rempte-git-repositories/","h":"#showing-git-information-in-the-command-prompt","p":669},{"i":688,"t":"We have only seen the absolute basics of Git in this chapter. Git is an amazingly powerful tool, I cannot recommend enough that you take the time to really learn how the commands work. Many users will use a graphical tool to work with Git - this is perfectly fine if it works for you. But to be an effective shell user you should really spend the time getting familiar with the core Git commands using the command-line. Git can sometimes seem overwhelming to people and has a reputation for being complex. This is somewhat unfair - version control of files is itself an inherently complex topic. No matter what tool you use, there will always be the challenges of managing changes across environments, dealing with conflicts, integrating work and so on. The basic Git functionality is incredibly good at making 99% of this work simple and straightforward, and Git gives you the tools to make the other 1% at least manageable. Spend some time getting familiar with the core Git commands that we have introduced in this chapter. As you find yourself becoming more familiar, here are the next set of topics I would recommend learning about: The gitignore file: this special file can be used to tell Git not to track changes for certain files. The .gitconfig file: this is Git's own dotfile and can be used to fine-tune Git configuration. Tags: these are labels you can add to commits, which are ideal for tracking releases for projects or other metadata. Diffs: knowing how to use git diff to see changes between branches, commits, the index and working tree and more will certainly help you as you use Git more. Stashes: If you want to save your changes, but they are currently not ready to be committed (perhaps because they are only partially complete), you can use the git stash command to store working tree changes. This lets you store the changes away, then checkout other branches, then restore the changes later when you are ready. Git Clean: The git clean command is very useful to help you remove unneeded files from your working tree. Interactive Staging: You can interactively stage files, parts of files (called 'hunks') or even individual lines directly from the shell, this can be invaluable when making sure that exactly the right changes are going into the index. Patch staging or checkout: I probably use the git add -p command to 'patch' changes dozens of times a day, this is my preferred mechanism of reviewing my changes as I stage them. Merge Strategies: Understanding how 'squashing' works (and its drawbacks) can be very useful when working with branches. Merge strategies are a useful topic to go deeper on. Rebasing: Rebasing can be used as a merge strategy but can also help in other scenarios, I would definitely recommend learning about rebasing if you have multiple people working on a repository, it can save a lot of trouble when integrating complex changes. Commit and Tag signing: Great for security sensitive users, you can use special keys to 'sign' your commits and improve the security of your repositories. GitHub Flow: A common workflow used with GitHub projects. There are numerous articles and online books on Git - I also recommend the excellent book \"Pro Git\" by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub.","s":"Scratching the Surface","u":"/part-5-building-your-toolkit/managing-rempte-git-repositories/","h":"#scratching-the-surface","p":669},{"i":690,"t":"Before we finish the chapter, let's do a quick review of the key commands for working with Git.

This is used to print special characters. \\h The hostname up to the first . dot. \\H The hostname. \\j The number of jobs currently managed by the shell. \\l The basename of the shell's terminal device. \\n A newline character. \\r A carriage return character. \\s The name of the shell, the basename of $0, for example: -bash. \\t The current time in 24-hour HH:MM:SS format. \\T The current time in 12-hour HH:MM:SS format. \\@ The current time in 12-hour am/pm format. \\A The current time in 24-hour HH:MM format. \\u The username of the current user. \\v The version of bash, for example: '5.0'. \\V The release of bash, with the patch level, for example: '5.0.17'. \\w The current working directory, with $HOME abbreviated with a ~ tilde symbol. \\W The current working directory name (rather than the entire path as is used for \\w). \\!

Some of these sequences are reasonably self-explanatory, some are a little more complex. Let's use some of them now to see how we can customise the prompt. Z-Shell The zsh shell uses different sequences. However, I suggest that you follow this chapter through to understand how Bash-like shells work and then you can apply the same techniques using Z-Shell. The Z-Shell documentation links are at the end of the chapter. Later on in this chapter we will introduce a function to help set the prompt, this function automatically converts to the prompt into Z-Shell format if needed. So the techniques you learn here should still be able to be used in Z-Shell. To change the prompt, all we need to do is set the PS1 variable. Let's start by changing the prompt so that it shows the date, time and the $ or # prompt symbol: dwmkerr@effective-shell-ubuntu-20:~$ PS1='\\d \\@ \\$ 'Sun Jun 06 12:43 PM $ In this example we've used the \\d (current date), \\@ (current time in am/pm format) and \\$ (prompt) and a space for our prompt. Notice that once we set PS1 in the shell, the prompt immediately changed. How about if we want to show the number of jobs, then the command number, then the prompt? Easy! Sun Jun 06 04:43 AM $ PS1='[\\j] (\\#) \\$ '[0] (4) $ sleep 10 &[1] 27598[1] (5) $ sleep 10 &[2] 27600[2] (6) $ sleep 10 &[3] 27601[3] (7) $ In this example we've used the \\j (current job) sequence, and surrounded it with square brackets. Then we used # (command number), surrounded by parentheses, then the \\$ shell prompt. I also started some background jobs, that just run the sleep (wait for a number of seconds) command, so that we can see that the number of jobs is changing. If you need a refresher on jobs, check Chapter 9 - Job Control. Note that we are using single quotes when specifying the value of the PS1. If we didn't use single quotes, then the shell would see the dollar symbol and think that we were trying to use a variable. For a reminder on how quoting works, check Chapter 19 - Variables, Reading Input, and Mathematics. If you are following along or trying this out in your own shell, you might have noticed that we don't have any colours for the new prompts we have set, everything is shown in white. To set the colour of the prompt we need to use some special characters.","s":"Special Characters","u":"/part-5-building-your-toolkit/customising-your-command-prompt","h":"#special-characters","p":693},{"i":704,"t":"In the earlier part of this chapter we saw that the default prompt on systems like Ubuntu contains lots of special characters. For reference, here is the value of the PS1 variable on a clean Ubuntu 20 installations: dwmkerr@effective-shell-ubuntu-20:~/effective-shell$ echo $PS1\\[\\e]0;\\u@\\h: \\w\\a\\]${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\\[\\033[01;32m\\]\\u@\\h\\[\\033[00m\\]:\\[\\033[01;34m\\]\\w\\[\\033[00m\\]\\$ Some of these characters we might now be able to recognise, such as \\u for the username and \\h for the host. The characters that start with the sequence \\033 are ANSI color codes. ANSI stands for American National Standards Institute, an organisation that was set up to attempt to set common standards for computing platforms. In the early days of Unix, each vendor developed their own special characters that could be used to control the visual formatting of output. These characters would vary from platform to platform, which made trying to create scripts or functionality that worked across multiple platforms complex. To deal with this, the ANSI organisation defined a common set of codes that could be printed to a terminal to control the visual style of the output. To tell a terminal that we want to use a special sequence to control the formatting or output of text, we can use these ANSI Escape Sequences. First we write out the characters \\033 or \\e. This is the sequence that represents the 'escape' key. The first version is the 'escape' key code written in 'octal' format (octal is a format where numbers are written in base eight, rather than base ten). The second sequence is an alternative way of writing the 'escape' key. When a terminal sees the escape sequence, it knows that the following sequence is used to define the formatting. The table below shows some of the different formats that can be used: Sequence Meaning Foreground Color \\033[30m Set foreground to 'black'. \\033[31m Set foreground to 'red'. \\033[32m Set foreground to 'green'. \\033[33m Set foreground to 'yellow'. \\033[34m Set foreground to 'blue'. \\033[35m Set foreground to 'magenta'. \\033[36m Set foreground to 'cyan'. \\033[37m Set foreground to 'white' (normally light grey) Foreground Color (Bold) \\033[1;30m Set foreground to 'bright black' (grey, or bold black) \\033[1;31m Set foreground to 'bright red' (or bold red). \\033[1;32m Set foreground to 'bright green' (or bold green). \\033[1;33m Set foreground to 'bright yellow' (or bold yellow). \\033[1;34m Set foreground to 'bright blue' (or bold blue). \\033[1;35m Set foreground to 'bright purple' (or bold purple). \\033[1;36m Set foreground to 'bright cyan' (or bold cyan). \\033[1;37m Set foreground to 'bright white' (or bold white). Background Color \\033[0;40m Set background to 'black'. \\033[0;41m Set background to 'red'. \\033[0;42m Set background to 'green'. \\033[0;43m Set background to 'brown'. \\033[0;44m Set background to 'blue'. \\033[0;45m Set background to 'purple'. \\033[0;46m Set background to 'cyan'. \\033[0;47m Set background to 'white' (normally light grey). Reset Colors \\033[0m Reset the text colors. Notice that each sequence starts with the 'escape' character, followed by [ or [1;. [ will use the 'normal' colour, [1; will use the 'bright' colour (how this is shown depends on your terminal emulator, in many modern emulators the text is shown in the same colour but is bold). You can also use [0; to clear any changes to the foreground or background before you set the new one. After this there are one of eight colours that can be used, specified by the characters in the range from 30m to 37m. The sequences in the range 40m to 47m set the background color. The sequence 0m resets the colors. With these codes we can print coloured text. When we write text that uses escape sequences, we need to tell the shell that our text needs to have these escape sequences processed properly. We can use the printf command or echo -e to do this. printf should be preferred as not all systems support the -e parameter for echo: printf \"\\033[31mRED\\033[0m\\n\"printf \"\\033[1;31mLIGHT RED\\033[0m\\n\"printf \"\\033[0;30m\\033[42mBLACK ON GREEN\\033[0m\\n\" The output of these commands will be the text below: REDLIGHT REDBLACK ON GREEN However, the colour of the foreground and background should change on each line. The exact formatting will change depending on the terminal emulator you use. Some terminal emulators use bold text for the 'bright' colours. With our new knowledge of how to use ANSI Escape Sequences to set the format of text, we can update our PS1 variable to show a prompt in colour. As an example, the code below sets the prompt to show the username in blue and the name of the current working directory in green, followed by a white $ prompt symbol, followed by the 'reset' sequence so that the text we type afterwards does not have its colour changed: dwmkerr@effective-shell-ubuntu-20:~/effective-shell$ PS1='\\033[34m\\u \\033[32m\\W \\033[37m\\$ 'dwmkerr effective-shell $ The prompt above will be shown in color on modern terminals. There is one snag to this. If you set your prompt in this way and press the 'up' and 'down' keys to cycle through previously entered commands, you might see that your shell prompt gets overwritten. The reason for this is that we need to tell the shell that colour and formatting sequences are 'non-printing' characters - the sequences don't actually produce written text in the terminal. To deal with this we need to surround each colour sequence with the special characters \\[ and \\]. This tells the shell when a 'non-printing' sequence starts and when it ends. To fix our PS1 variable, we can use the value below: PS1='\\[\\033[34m\\]\\u \\[\\033[32m\\]\\W \\[\\033[37m\\]\\$ \\[\\033[0m\\]' Phew! This is a lot of work to go to just to format the colour of the prompt. Later in this chapter we'll build a script that will make it far easier to work with colours and text formatting!","s":"Changing the Colour and Text Formatting","u":"/part-5-building-your-toolkit/customising-your-command-prompt","h":"#changing-the-colour-and-text-formatting","p":693},{"i":706,"t":"When we set the PS1 variable, we are simply setting it to a string. This string could be anything, for example: dwmkerr@effective-shell-ubuntu-20:~$ PS1='-Ready?---> '-Ready?---> We don't need to limit ourselves to the special sequences we've seen so far in this chapter - we can run any commands we like to build a command prompt. For example, we could use the use the ls (list directory contents) and wc (count lines and words) commands to count the number of files and folders in the current directory and show that in the prompt: PS1=\"$(ls -al | wc -l | tr -d '[:space:]') \\\\$ \" When I run this command, my prompt will look something like this: 32 $ We have used the $() notation to run a sub-shell that lists the contents of the current directory and then pipes them to wc -l, which counts the number of lines. Finally we pipe the result into tr -d '[:space:] to remove the whitespace around the line count. To use the $() notation, or any shell variable, we have to use double quotes in the string, otherwise the shell will write out those characters literally. And because we are using double quotes, we need an extra backslash before last \\$ character to escape it, so that the shell doesn't try to treat it as a variable. However - there's a subtle bug in this PS1 configuration! Let's see what happens when we change directories: 32 $ cd effective-shell/32 $ touch newfile-{1..10}32 $ In the session above I changed to the effective-shell directory. But the count is still showing as 32. This is suspicious. After creating ten new files with touch newfile-{1..10} the count still shows 32. The reason for this is that 32 was the number of files and folders in the current directory at the time the PS1 variable was set. We changed the PS1 variable once - what we really need to do is have the prompt count the files each time the prompt is shown. Fortunately, there is a special syntax for this! We just put a \\ backslash character in front of the $ dollar symbol for the sub-shell: PS1=\"\\$(ls -al | wc -l | tr -d '[:space:]') \\\\$ \" The backslash before the sub-shell tells the shell that it should evaluate the sub-shell each time the prompt is shown: 32 $ touch newfile-{1..10}42 $ This is where the real power of the PS1 variable comes into play. Because we set it using the shell itself, we can run any commands that we find useful and integrate their output into our command prompt. Let's see this in action by creating a script to make customising our prompt far easier and more intuitive!","s":"Adding Data to the Command Prompt","u":"/part-5-building-your-toolkit/customising-your-command-prompt","h":"#adding-data-to-the-command-prompt","p":693},{"i":708,"t":"We can write a script to make it much easier to customise our shell prompt. Rather than having to remember each of the colour sequences, we can store them in variables to make them easier to refer to. We can also run any commands that we'd like to run to allow us to show extra information. There is a script in the Effective Shell samples at ~/effective-shell/scripts/set_ps1.sh that we can use to set our PS1 variable in a much more user-friendly way. Downloading the Samples Run the following commands in your shell to download the samples: curl effective.sh | sh The set_ps1.sh script is quite long, so let's go through it bit-by-bit. # Keep track of the original PS1 value._original_ps1=\"${PS1}\"set_ps1() { # Foreground colours. local fg_black=$(tput setaf 0) # \\033[30m local fg_red=$(tput setaf 1) # \\033[31m local fg_green=$(tput setaf 2) # \\033[32m local fg_yellow=$(tput setaf 3) # \\033[33m local fg_blue=$(tput setaf 4) # \\033[34m local fg_magenta=$(tput setaf 5) # \\033[35m local fg_cyan=$(tput setaf 6) # \\033[36m local fg_white=$(tput setaf 7) # \\033[37m # Background colours. local bg_black=$(tput setab 0) # \\033[40m local bg_red=$(tput setab 1) # \\033[41m local bg_green=$(tput setab 2) # \\033[42m local bg_yellow=$(tput setab 3) # \\033[43m local bg_blue=$(tput setab 4) # \\033[44m local bg_magenta=$(tput setab 5) # \\033[45m local bg_cyan=$(tput setab 6) # \\033[46m local bg_white=$(tput setab 7) # \\033[47m First, we store the current value of PS1 in a variable named _original_ps1. This is so that later on if we have changed the PS1 variable, we can change it back to what it was set to originally. The _ underscore in the variable name is a convention that indicates that this variable is used internally in the script. Next, we define a function called set_ps1. Then we use the tput command (query terminfo database) to get the exact escape sequences for the foreground and background colours. For easy reference the escape sequences are shown to the right of each command as a comment. Next, we get the escape sequences for some of the other formatting options, such as 'bold' (which will be 'bright' on some terminals): # Text styles and reset. Note that on some terminals 'bold' will produce # light colours for bright colours, on others it will actually show the text # in bold. local bold=$(tput bold) # \\033[1m local dim=$(tput dim) # \\033[2m local start_underline=$(tput smul) # \\033[4m local stop_underline=$(tput mmul) # \\033[24m local reset=$(tput sgr0) # \\033[0m You might recall the tput command from the section 'colourising output' in Chapter 23 - Useful Patterns for Shell Scripts. After this we use a case statement to set the PS1 variable based on the value of the first parameter that was provided to the function: # Depending on the name of the theme provided, set the prompt. case $1 in debian) # Debian/Ubuntu style: # \\u@\\h - username@host (bold/green) # \\w - working directory (bold/blue) # \\$ - prompt (# if root, otherwise $) (bold/white) PS1=\"\\[${bold}${fg_green}\\]\\u@\\h:\\[${fg_blue}\\]\\w\\[${fg_white}\\]\\\\$\\[${reset}\\] \" ;; datetime) # A style that shows the date and time: # \\D{%Y-%m-%d} - the year/month/date (in white) # \\@ - the time (in green) # \\$ - prompt (# if root, otherwise $) (bold/white) PS1=\"\\[${fg_white}\\]\\D{%Y-%m-%d} \\[${bold}${fg_green}\\]\\@\\[${fg_white}\\] \\\\$\\[${reset}\\] \" ;; # Add your own themes here! *) # Restore PS1 to its original value. PS1=\"${_original_ps1}\" ;; esac # If we are in Z-Shell convert the PS1 to use Z-Shell format. [ -n \"$ZSH_VERSION\" ] && PS1=$(_to_zsh \"$PS1\")} In this code we check the first parameter of the function $1. If it matches the string debian we set the PS1 variable to a format that is similar to what is used by Debian Linux distributions. If it matches the string datetime we set PS1 to a prompt that shows the current date and time. If any other value is used, we reset the PS1 variable back to its original value. Before we complete the function, we check to see if ZSH_VERSION is set - this is to check whether we are in a zsh shell. If we are, then we use the _to_zsh function to convert the PS1 string into the format used by Z-Shell. Finally, we use the } to complete the definition of the function. Z-Shell The zsh shell differs considerably from Bash and Bash-like shells in how it handles the PS1 variable. There is no need for the \\[ or \\] sequences, there are built in color variables such as $fg[red] for 'red' and the special sequences are different (for example, rather than \\u for username, Z-Shell uses %n). The set_ps1 function in the samples converts the PS1 string to Z-Shell format if it is running in Z-Shell. However, this conversion is not perfect as some of the sequences shown in this chapter do not have an equivalent in Z-Shell. If you want to customise a Z-Shell prompt you can check the manual page man zshmisc and search for PROMPT\\ SEQUENCES. Notice how much easier it is to specify the values for the PS1 string when we have the colours and formatting defined in variables! We still need to wrap the formatting characters with \\[ and \\] to make sure that the shell knows how long the command prompt is, but this is far easier to read than the samples we saw before where we provide the ANSI Escape Sequences. To use this script, we can simply source it into our current session and then change the prompt by calling the set_ps1 function: $ dwmkerr@effective-shell-ubuntu-20:~$ source ~/effective-shell/scripts/set_ps1.shdwmkerr@effective-shell-ubuntu-20:~$ set_ps1 datetime2021-06-06 04:10 PM $ set_ps1 debiandwmkerr@effective-shell-ubuntu-20:~$ This script has a placeholder in the case statement for you to add your own 'themes' that you want to be able to use in your shell. For example, one 'theme' I often use is below: git) # A style that shows some git information. # Build a string that shows: # - The branch (underlined if 'main') in green # - A red exclamation if there are any local changes not committed # - An indicator of the number of stashed items, if any. _git_info() { # Git details. local git_branch_name=\"$(git branch --show-current)\" local git_any_local_changes=\"$(git status --porcelain=v1 2>/dev/null)\" local git_stash_count=\"$(git rev-list --walk-reflogs --count \\ refs/stash -- 2>/dev/null)\" # Ignore error when no stashes local git_info=\"\" if [ \"${git_branch_name}\" = \"main\" ]; then git_info=\"${bold}${fg_green}${start_underline}${git_branch_name}${reset}\" else git_info=\"${bold}${fg_green}${git_branch_name}${reset}\" fi if ! [ -z \"${git_any_local_changes}\" ]; then # Note that we have to be careful to put the exclamation mark # in single quotes so that it is not expanded to the last command! git_info=\"${git_info} ${bold}${fg_red}\"'!'\"${reset}\" fi if [ \"${git_stash_count:-0}\" -gt 0 ]; then git_info=\"${git_info} ${bold}${fg_yellow}${git_stash_count} in stash${reset}\" fi printf \"${git_info}\" } # Now show a Debian style prompt with the git info above it. PS1=\"\\$(_git_info)\\n\\\\[${bold}${fg_green}\\]\\u@\\h:\\[${fg_blue}\\]\\w\\[${fg_white}\\]\\\\$\\[${reset}\\] \";; Don't worry if you are not familiar with 'git', we will see it in a couple of chapters. The important thing is that this snippet shows that you can add almost any kind of information that you might find useful to your command prompt. When I run set_ps1 git, my prompt looks like this: feat/chapter-26-customise-your-command-prompt ! 3 in stashdwmkerr@effective-shell-ubuntu-20:~/repos/github/dwmkerr/effective-shell$ My prompt is now spread across two lines - the first shows me the branch I am on, a red exclamation point if I have made changes but not saved them, and the number of items I have in my 'stash'. The second line shows the standard Debian prompt. The code shown above has been slightly simplified to make it more readable, you can see the exact version in the samples. You can use the ~/effective-shell/scripts/set_ps1.sh file to build your own 'themes' and easily change between them in the shell. If you want to always source this file into your shell on startup, just add the following like to ~/.bashrc: source \"~/effective-shell/scripts/set_ps1.sh\" You could also set the default PS1 variable immediately after sourcing the script if you like: # Source the set_ps1 function and set our 'theme' to Debian.source \"~/effective-shell/scripts/set_ps1.sh\"set_ps1 \"debian\" In the next chapter we will look at some sensible ways we can organise files like the set_ps1.sh script and the ~/.bashrc file so that we can easily manage our customisations and share them across different machines.","s":"A Shell Script to Customise the Prompt","u":"/part-5-building-your-toolkit/customising-your-command-prompt","h":"#a-shell-script-to-customise-the-prompt","p":693},{"i":710,"t":"There are some other variables that you might want to use to configure your prompt: Variable Description PS2 This is shown when performing 'continuation' and is normally set to >. PS3 This is shown when the select command is used and is normally not set, so the default #? is used. PS4 This is shown when tracing with set -x and is normally set to +. PROMPT_DIRTRIM This can be set to limit the number of directories shown with using \\w or \\W in your prompt. PROMPT_COMMAND This can be set to limit the number of directories shown with using \\w or \\W in your prompt. Let's take a look at how each one can be used. PS2 If we have a long line of text in the shell, we can start a 'continuation' by entering the backlash symbol: $ echo \"This is a really really \\> long \\> long line of text\"This is a really really long long line of text The > symbol is shown when we press 'enter' after entering a \\ backslash symbol. This symbol is used to remind us that we are not entering a new command, we are just continuing the current command on a new line. You can change the text shown by setting PS2. PS3 PS3 allows you to specify the prompt used by the select command: $ PS3=\"Your choice? : \"$ select fruit in Apples Pears; do echo \"$fruit\"; done1) Apples2) PearsYour choice? : The PS3 variable is not set by default. If it is not set, then the select statement uses #? for the prompt. PS4 When you enable 'tracing' by setting the -x option, each traced line starts with a + symbol: $ set -x$ echo \"The date is $(date)\"++ date+ echo 'The date is Sun 06 Jun 2021 08:49:07 AM UTC'The date is Sun 06 Jun 2021 08:49:07 AM UTC You can change this symbol by setting the PS4 option. PROMPT_DIRTRIM If you set a value in the PROMPT_DIRTRIM variable, the shell will not show the entire contents of the working directory when you use the special \\w sequence in a prompt variable. Instead, it will limit the number of directories shown to the value in PROPMT_DIRTRIM and use an 'ellipses' for the rest (and ellipses is written as three dots). For example, if I was in the folder ~/effective-shell/logs/apm-logs and had PROMPT_DIRTRIM set to 2, then on Debian my command prompt would look like this: dwmkerr@effective-shell-ubuntu-20:~/.../logs/apm-logs$ Note that only the last two parts of the path to the folder are shown. PROMPT_COMMAND The PROMPT_COMMAND variable can be used to specify a command or set of commands to run before the prompt is shown. A common use for the PROMPT_COMMAND is to save and reload the shell command history before each command is run: PROMPT_COMMAND=\"history -a; history -c; history -r; $PROMPT_COMMAND\" In this example, we used the history (display or manipulate history list) command three times. First with -a to append the lines from the current session to the history file, then -c to clear the shell history in the session, then -r to reload it. For many shells the history of commands is only updated when the shell is closed, this change means that even if the shell is terminated unexpectedly, each command we have executed will still have been written to the history.","s":"Additional Prompt Configuration","u":"/part-5-building-your-toolkit/customising-your-command-prompt","h":"#additional-prompt-configuration","p":693},{"i":712,"t":"Z-Shell does not use the same sequences to format the prompt-string variables. However, the set_ps1.sh script included in the Effective Shell samples will convert the Bash-style PS1 variable into Z-Shell formatted prompt strings automatically. For Z-Shell users, you might also consider the very popular \"Oh-My-Zsh\" project. This is a collection of themes and plugins that add many more aliases, functions, autocompletions and more to the shell. One of the most popular features of \"Oh-My-Zsh\" is its large collection of themes that customise how the prompt looks. However, just like with most things in computing, I would strongly recommend that you learn how the fundamentals work as they are described in this chapter before using \"Oh-My-Zsh\" themes. This will help you understand how things like \"Oh-My-Zsh\" actually work under the hood. You might also realise that you don't need to install an additional package to get the styling you want. For example, my own shell prompt includes information on Git, the working directory (trimmed to only show up to three entries), but only requires a few lines of setup and works consistently in Bash-like shells and Z-Shell.

Sometimes new files get added, old files get deleted, files get changed, things get moved around and so on. Git is a version control system that allows you to track changes to files and folders. This means that you can maintain a history of all of the changes that have been made, when they were made, who made them and why. You can also maintain multiple 'branches' of your files and folders - these branches can be used as working environments where you can make changes, without affecting the current 'main' set of files. Git was written by Linus Torvalds (the creator of Linux) in 2006. \"Git\" is slang for an annoying person - Linus joked that he always names projects after himself, first Linux and now Git. There were many version control systems around before Git, such as CVS (Concurrent Version System) and SVN (Subversion, an system similar to CVS but with some improvements). There were also a number of proprietary and commercial solutions. In recent years Git has become without a doubt the most popular version control system globally, and many highly popular software collaboration systems such as GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket use Git as their underlying version control system, adding additional features on top.","s":"What is Git","u":"/part-5-building-your-toolkit/controlling-changes-with-git","h":"#what-is-git","p":715},{"i":720,"t":"All of the information about a set of files or folders that you are tracking the changes for is stored in a Git repository. We can create a Git repository by running the git init (initialise Git repository) command. Let's see this in action be creating a Git repository to track changes to our 'dotfiles' folder. Our 'dotfiles' folder is a folder where we keep simple shell configuration - you can read about how to create a folder like this in Chapter 27 - Managing Your Dotfiles or you can download the Effective Shell samples to get a copy of the 'dotfiles' folder. Downloading the Samples Run the following command in your shell to download the samples: curl effective.sh | sh If you have installed the samples, you can copy the ~/effective-shell/dotfiles folder to your home directory - this is where we will create our Git repository and start using the Git commands: $ cp -r ~/effective-shell/dotfiles ~/dotfiles$ cd ~/dotfiles We have created the ~/dotfiles folder in our home directory from the samples and moved into it. Now we will initialise a Git repository with the git init command, and choose a 'branch' name with the git checkout command: $ git initInitialized empty Git repository in /home/dwmkerr/dotfiles/.git/$ git checkout -b main We'll see the git checkout command in detail soon. For now it is enough to know that we have initialised a new Git repository and chosen the name of our 'main' branch. Initialising a Git Repository with a Branch Name If you are using Git 2.2 or later, you can initialise a repository and set the branch name with a single command: $ git init -b main If you see the error message error: unknown switch 'b' then this means that you are using a version of Git that does not have the -b (initial branch name) flag (any version of Git lower than 2.2).","s":"Creating a Git Repository","u":"/part-5-building-your-toolkit/controlling-changes-with-git","h":"#creating-a-git-repository","p":715},{"i":722,"t":"We now have an empty Git repository. We can use the git status (show the working tree status) command to show some information on the files in the working tree. The working tree is the folder that we are using Git to track changes for, in our case ~/dotfiles: $ git statusOn branch mainNo commits yetUntracked files: (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed) install.sh shell.d/ shell.shnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track) The first thing that git status tells us is the name of the branch we are on. We'll look at branches in detail shortly. The next thing we see is that there are no commits - commits are sets of changes that we track. Finally, git is telling us that there are three files that are 'untracked'. These are the install.sh and shell.sh files as well as the shell.d folder. If we are going to use Git to track changes to these files, we need to add them to the repository. We can do that with the git add (add file contents to index) command: $ git add . The git add command takes a list of file paths. We have used the special dot folder to represent the entire current directory. Let's take a look at the status again: $ git statusOn branch mainNo commits yetChanges to be committed: (use \"git rm --cached <file>...\" to unstage) new file: install.sh new file: shell.d/set_ps1.sh new file: shell.sh Git is now telling us that we have three new files which are ready to be committed. At the moment these files are in the index. The index, or staging area, is the set of changes that we are preparing to commit. These changes are not yet stored in the repository. When we add files to the index we are 'staging' changes. When we remove changes from the index, we are 'unstaging' changes. Think of the index as a working area where we can build up a set of changes that we would later like to record in the repository. We could add more files to the index before we actually save them to the repository in a commit. If we were to visualise what we've done so far, it would look like this: Our working tree is the folder associated with our Git repository, this is the ~/dotfiles folder. Our index is initially empty. When we run the git add command, we have told Git we want to add three files to the repository. Our 'staging area' has three files in it. Our Git repository does not have any commits recorded yet. What if we realised that we don't want to add one of these files to the repository? To remove a file from the index we can use the git reset (reset changes) command. Let's reset the ~/dotfiles/shell.d/set_ps1.sh file and check the status: $ git reset shell.d/set_ps1.sh$ git statusOn branch mainNo commits yetChanges to be committed: (use \"git rm --cached <file>...\" to unstage) new file: install.sh new file: shell.shUntracked files: (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed) shell.d/ The git reset command has removed a change from the index - telling Git that we don't want to 'stage' one of the files. Git now tells us there are two files in the index and one that is not tracked. Here's how we can visualise the changes we've made: You can also reset changes by using the git rm --cached (remove changes from index) command. However, I think this is a little harder to work with as you have to remember to use the --cached flag to tell Git that you are removing from the index and not the repository. We'll see the git rm command a little later in the chapter. Remember - at this stage we have not changed a single file! Nothing we have done has changed the content of any of the files in the working tree, and the only thing that has changed in the Git repository is the 'index' - the current set of files that we are 'staging'. Now let's look at how we can commit our changes with the git commit command.","s":"Adding and Resetting Changes to the Index","u":"/part-5-building-your-toolkit/controlling-changes-with-git","h":"#adding-and-resetting-changes-to-the-index","p":715},{"i":724,"t":"Once we are happy with the set of changes in the index, we can use the git commit (record changes to the repository) command. Now run the git commit command: $ git commit At this stage your shell editor will open up, with the text shown below: # Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines staring# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.## On branch main## Initial commit## Changes to be committed:# new file: install.sh# new file: shell.sh## Untracked files:# shell.d/# The reason you shell editor opens is that the git commit command would like you to provide a message describing your changes.

This is provided as a convenience - Git is telling you the status of the index. Anything that starts with a hash symbol is a comment and will not be stored in the commit message. Save the file by pressing Ctrl+W and close the editor with Ctrl+X (these are the commands for the nano editor, if you are using a different editor use whatever commands are needed to save and close). When the editor closes you'll see a confirmation below the git commit command: $ git commit[main (root-commit) 01e7a10] add the 'install' and 'shell' scripts 2 files changed, 90 insertions(+) create mode 100755 install.sh create mode 100644 shell.sh This message tells us that two files have changed and 90 lines have been added. It also lists the files we have added. At this point we have created our first commit. We can visualise the process we have gone through like this: We 'staged' a set of changes and then 'committed' these changes. We now have a single commit in our repository. Our files are still unchanged, but our Git repository now has a single commit in it that tracks the two files we added. Let's run git status again: $ git statusOn branch mainUntracked files: (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed) shell.d/nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track) The git status command tells us we're still on the 'main' branch, and that there is one file which is not tracked. Let's create a second commit by adding this file. When you run the git commit command below, enter a message to describe the commit: $ git add .$ git commit[main d7e1bb9] add the 'shell.d' folder 1 file changed, 228 insertions(+) create mode 100644 shell.d/set_ps1.sh We have now created a second commit - our timeline will look like this: If we run the git status command one last time we will see that everything in the working tree is tracked in Git: $ git statusOn branch mainnothing to commit, working tree clean The concepts of the 'index', the 'working tree' and the Git repository itself can take a bit of getting used to! If you have not used Git before and this seems like a lot to take on board, don't worry, people often find Git quite hard at first.

However, there are a couple of things that you should bear in mind: Try to keep the first line to 50 characters or less. This is known as the 'subject' line - keeping this short will make it easier to look through the log of changes later and see what each commit means. If you want to add more detail, leave a blank line after the subject line and then include as much text as you like. Common convention is to wrap the text at 80 characters so that it will fit in a typical shell window. There are many articles available online that suggest conventions for how to write your commit messages. You can explore these as you get more familiar with Git. The only convention I would strongly recommend that you follow is to make sure that your Git message makes sense - it should describe what the change is and ideally why you have made it. It is easy to forget why changes were made after time has passed - writing good commit messages will save you a lot of time in the long run and also make it easier for others to work with your repository!

We can create new 'branches' and put commits on them to allow us to make a series of changes that are isolated from each other. We can create branches using the git branch (list, create or delete branches) or git checkout (switch branches or restore working tree) command. To show these features in action, we'll create a new branch called aliases and add some files to it: $ git checkout -b aliasesSwitched to a new branch 'aliases'$ git statusOn branch aliasesnothing to commit, working tree clean We have used the git checkout command to 'switch' to another branch. The -b (new branch) option tells Git that we want to create a new branch. The git status command now shows the new branch name when we run it. Let's create a new file which includes an alias for the git status command, then let's see what git status tells us about the status of the working tree: $ echo 'alias gs=\"git status\"' >> ./shell.d/git_aliases.sh$ git statusOn branch aliasesUntracked files: (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed) shell.d/git_aliases.shnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track) Excellent - we have a new file and Git knows that it is not currently tracked.

We now have a series of commits that looks like this: Our new ~/dotfiles/shell.d/git_aliases.sh file has been committed to the aliases branch. We can switch back to the main branch at any time with git checkout: $ git checkout mainSwitched to branch 'main'$ tree.├── install.sh├── shell.d│ └── set_ps1.sh└── shell.sh When we switch back to the main branch and look at our working tree we can see that the git_aliases.sh file is not present. This is very cool - by passing the name of the branch we want to switch to as the parameter to the git checkout command we can switch branches. If we are on the main branch we don't see the git_aliases.sh file, because the commit that added is was not on the main branch.

Conflicts occur when a set of changes are made that cannot be merged without some kind of manual intervention to decide which of the changes are correct. Here are a few common scenarios that might lead to merge conflicts: In one branch a file is deleted and in another branch the file is changed - when we merge should we delete the file or keep the version with the changes? In one branch a file is edited and in another branch the same part of the file is edited in a different way - which edit should we keep? Should we keep both? In one branch we add content to the end of a file and in another branch we add different content - which of these changes should come first? A lot of the time you can avoid conflicts by making sure that you don't keep branches for too long - if other people are merging changes into the main branch while you are working on another branch, you are drifting from the main branch. You should either regularly update your branch with the changes in main or merge your changes into main. There are many different ways for version control systems to manage conflicts. Let's see how Git does it by creating a conflict. First, we will create a branch that adds a new alias to the git_aliases.sh file: # Create a 'glog_alias' branch and commit a file.git checkout -b glog_aliasecho 'alias glog=\"git log --graph --oneline\"' >> ./shell.d/git_aliases.shgit commit -a -m \"add the 'glog' alias\" Now we'll go back to the main branch and add another alias: # Go back to 'main' and commit a change to the same file as the last one.git checkout mainecho 'alias glog=\"git log\"' >> ./shell.d/git_aliases.shgit commit -a -m \"add the 'glog' alias\" We've changed the same file in two branches - if we try to merge we will get a conflict: $ git merge glog_aliasAuto-merging shell.d/git_aliases.shCONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in shell.d/git_aliases.shAutomatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result. When Git cannot automatically consolidate the changes into a single merge commit, it aborts the merge process. No new commits have been made - the conflicted files with their changes are in the index. We have to now manually fix these files. Let's see what the status shows: $ git statusOn branch mainYou have unmerged paths. (fix conflicts and run \"git commit\") (use \"git merge --abort\" to abort the merge)Unmerged paths: (use \"git add <file>...\" to mark resolution) both modified: shell.d/git_aliases.shno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\") Git is telling us that we are currently in the process of trying to fix a merge conflict. It is telling us that we need to fix the shell.d/git_aliases.sh file, then use git add to stage the changes and commit the result. To resolve the conflict, we need to edit the file. If you open the file in an editor it will look like this: alias gs=\"git status\"alias gcm=\"git checkout main\"alias gm=\"git merge\"<<<<<<< HEADalias glog=\"git log\"=======alias glog=\"git log --graph --oneline\">>>>>>> glog_alias Many modern editors will immediately recognise the sequence of symbols that Git uses to indicate conflicts and highlight them. The <<<<<< HEAD line indicates the changes in the current branch, the ======= line is a separator, and the >>>>>> glog_alias line indicates that everything since the ======= line is the changes in the glog_alias branch. We can see why Git has not been able to merge these changes - each branch has a new line and Git doesn't know which one is correct. So rather than make an assumption (such as the most recent change should 'win'), Git is asking us to choose. In your editor, update the file to look like this: alias gs=\"git status\"alias gcm=\"git checkout main\"alias gm=\"git merge\"alias glog=\"git log --graph --oneline\" We have chosen the version of the glog alias that was in the glog_alias branch. But you could choose either - or replace the content with a new line. You can make any changes you like - just be sure to remove the lines that start with <<<, === and >>>. We don't even have to use the changes from one of the branches - we could remove the lines or add completely new ones. We change the file to make sure that the merged result makes sense. In the example above we deleted one of the glog aliases, but we could have also just changed the name of one of them: alias gs=\"git status\"alias gcm=\"git checkout main\"alias gm=\"git merge\"alias glog=\"git log\"alias ggraph=\"git log --graph --oneline\" We can now use git add to mark the file as resolved, and run git commit: $ git add shell.d/git_aliases.sh The editor will open showing a sensible commit message: Merge branch 'glog_alias'# Conflicts:# shell.d/git_aliases.sh## It looks like you may be committing a merge.# If this is not correct, please run# git update-ref -d MERGE_HEAD# and try again.# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.## On branch main The message is just like the earlier merge commit message, but the comments show a little more information (the files that were conflicted). Save the file and close the editor to complete the commit.

Going into them is beyond the scope of this book. However, it is useful to know that you have a lot of functionality to control how branches are merged available to you if you want to explore further. There are merge strategies that allow you to try and create a single, coherent history between two branches, rather than creating a merge commit, there are options to 'squash' all of the commits from one branch into another and more. I would suggest that as you become more familiar with the basics of how Git works, you get a little deeper on this topic - searching online for \"Git Merge Strategies\" will bring up many articles going into detail.","s":"Other Merge Strategies","u":"/part-5-building-your-toolkit/controlling-changes-with-git","h":"#other-merge-strategies","p":715},{"i":740,"t":"It is quite simple to remove files from your Git Repository. You can either ask Git to remove the file for you, or just delete the file yourself and then tell Git that you have removed it. Let's see both ways in action. First we'll use the git rm (remove files from the working tree and index) command: $ git rm install.shrm 'install.sh' The git rm command removes the file from your working tree and stages the deletion. We can see that the file is staged for deletion if we run git status: $ git statusOn branch mainChanges to be committed: (use \"git restore --staged <file>...\" to unstage) deleted: install.sh The deletion is only in the index at this stage - we need to run git commit to commit the deletion. If we want to restore the file, we can use git checkout to get the file back from Git: $ git checkout HEAD install.sh We use HEAD to tell Git what commit we want to checkout the file from - head means the current commit we are on (which is the most recent commit on main). Another common way to delete a file is to simply remove it from the file-system: $ rm install.sh$ git statusOn branch mainChanges not staged for commit: (use \"git add/rm <file>...\" to update what will be committed) (use \"git restore <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory) deleted: install.sh At this point Git knows the file is missing, but the deletion is not yet staged - because we haven't explicitly told Git that we want to remove this file as part of the commit we are creating. To confirm that we want to remove the file we can use: $ git rm install.sh We could also run git add install.sh - think of this like saying 'stage my change to index.sh' - we are adding a change to the index. I often just run git add . to add all of my changes (including deletions) to the stage. At this point we can make any other changes we like, stage them, and then commit. Let's restore the file: $ git reset .Unstaged changes after reset:D install.sh$ git checkout .Updated 1 path from the index This is another way to restore the file - first we reset all of the changes to the index with git reset ., then we checkout all of the files in the current commit with git checkout .. But be careful with this method - it will also reset any other changes you have made. I prefer the git checkout HEAD <file_path> method as it is more explicit and only restores one file. What about if we rename a file? Let's rename the install file and see what the status is: $ mv install.sh install_dotfiles.shChanges not staged for commit: (use \"git add/rm <file>...\" to update what will be committed) (use \"git restore <file>...\" to discard changes in working directory) deleted: install.shUntracked files: (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed) install_dotfiles.shno changes added to commit (use \"git add\" and/or \"git commit -a\") We've renamed the file, but when we run git status it is telling us that the file is missing, and there is a new untracked file. But Git is smart enough to know when we move a file - if we run git add . to add all changes in the working tree to the index, Git will recognise that we have not deleted and added a file, but instead renamed it: $ git add .$ git statusOn branch mainChanges to be committed: (use \"git restore --staged <file>...\" to unstage) renamed: install.sh -> install_dotfiles.sh Let's restore the file by renaming it back to what it was and adding these changes: $ mv install_dotfiles.sh install.sh$ git add .$ git statusOn branch mainnothing to commit, working tree clean We can also use the git mv (move or rename a file) command to move or rename a file and stage the changes in one go: $ git mv install.sh install_dotfiles.shChanges to be committed: (use \"git restore --staged <file>...\" to unstage) renamed: install.sh -> install_dotfiles.sh We can also restore the changes by using git mv: $ git mv install_dotfiles.sh install.sh$ git statusOn branch mainnothing to commit, working tree clean These commands work equally well with folders, or lists of files and folders.","s":"Deleting and Renaming Files","u":"/part-5-building-your-toolkit/controlling-changes-with-git","h":"#deleting-and-renaming-files","p":715},{"i":742,"t":"We've already seen how the git checkout command can be used to switch branches.

This is extremely useful if you want to see how your files looked at an earlier point in time, or restore your files to a previous state.

We can checkout any commit by providing its SHA. We don't need to provide the entire SHA (which is good, because they are normally quite long), we only need to provide enough letters to uniquely identify the commit, so normally four or five digits is plenty. Notice that the most recent commit is marked with the text HEAD. The HEAD is where Git is currently 'pointing' to - we will see how to move the head shortly (the term HEAD also refers to the most recent commit of a branch). At the moment we can visualise our Git log, with the commits, branches and HEAD like so: We can restore the working tree to the state of any of the commits by running git checkout <commit_sha>: $ git checkout f61369dNote: switching to 'f61369d'.You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimentalchanges and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in thisstate without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch. This snippet moved our HEAD to the third commit in our repository. If you look at the files in your working tree you'll see that they are in exact state that they were when we made our third commit. Visually, we have moved the HEAD as shown below: The warning that says we are in a 'detached HEAD' state is telling us that our current position in the history is not at the 'tip' of a branch - this means we cannot create a new commit without first starting a new branch. If we want to move back to the 'tip' of our main branch (or any other branch), we can use git checkout <branch_name>: $ git checkout main This moves us back to the 'tip' of the main branch. Git has a very convenient syntax we can use to move backwards. We can specify a branch name, a SHA or 'HEAD', use a ~ tilde character, and then provide the number of commits we want to move 'backwards': $ git checkout HEAD~1 This command moves the 'head' backwards one commit. This is useful if you realise you have made a mistake with your commit or recent commits and want to go backwards. Remember - whenever you run git checkout <branch_name> Git moves the HEAD to the tip of the branch by default.","s":"Restoring Your Working Tree","u":"/part-5-building-your-toolkit/controlling-changes-with-git","h":"#restoring-your-working-tree","p":715},{"i":744,"t":"In this chapter we looked at some of the core concepts behind Git - the repository, the working tree and the index.

Once you starting using these commands you'll find yourself using them regularly. Let's start with head. Imagine we have a data file which has been sent to us, we don't know exactly what is in it, but we know it is large. How can we take a quick look? $ head ~/effective-shell/data/top100.csv\"Rank\",\"Rating\",\"Title\",\"Reviews\"\"1\",\"97\",\"Black Panther (2018)\",\"515\"\"2\",\"94\",\"Avengers: Endgame (2019)\",\"531\"\"3\",\"93\",\"Us (2019)\",\"536\"\"4\",\"97\",\"Toy Story 4 (2019)\",\"445\"\"5\",\"99\",\"Lady Bird (2017)\",\"393\"\"6\",\"100\",\"Citizen Kane (1941)\",\"94\"\"7\",\"97\",\"Mission: Impossible - Fallout (2018)\",\"430\"\"8\",\"98\",\"The Wizard of Oz (1939)\",\"120\"\"9\",\"96\",\"The Irishman (2019)\",\"441\" The head command just shows the first ten lines of a file. Here we can see that this is a comma separated values file which seems to be a list of movies. This file is actually a list of the top 100 films on 'Rotten Tomatoes' at the time of writing, with the score, tomato meter, name and number of votes. We'll use it a lot in this chapter to demonstrate text manipulation. You can use the -n flag to specify the number of lines you want to see, for example: $ head -n 3 ~/effective-shell/data/top100.csv\"Rank\",\"Rating\",\"Title\",\"Reviews\"\"1\",\"97\",\"Black Panther (2018)\",\"515\"\"2\",\"94\",\"Avengers: Endgame (2019)\",\"531\" The tail command works in the same way - but looks at the end of a file. This is more useful when you are looking content which changes over time, like log files. In this case you probably want to see only the most recent entries. Here's how we can see the ten most recent commands we entered in our shell: $ tail $HISTFILE: 1606818280:0;ls: 1606818300:0;ln -s $(pwd) ~/effective-shell: 1606818308:0;cat ~/effective-shell/data/top100.csv: 1606818342:0;head -n 3 ~/effective-shell/data/top100.csv: 1606819062:0;head ~/effective-shell/data/top100.csv: 1606819647:0;gcd: 1606819649:0;git stash: 1606819650:0;gcd: 1606819662:0;git stash pop: 1606819803:0;tail $HISTFILE What is $HISTFILE? Most Bash-like shells keep a file called the history file. This is essentially a record of all of the commands which have been written in the shell. The history command can be used to show the contents of this file. But if we want to work with the file directly, we can find its location with the special variable called $HISTFILE. Enter help history for more information on the shell history. We can be more specific, just like with head, by specifying the number of lines to show: $ tail -n 3 $HISTFILE: 1606819650:0;gcd: 1606819662:0;git stash pop: 1606819803:0;tail $HISTFILE tail can also be used to show the changes to a file in real time. Add the -f flag to follow the contents of the file - this means the tail command show each new line as it gets added to the file. To try it out, run the following command in one shell: $ tail -f $HISTFILE In another terminal window, start entering commands. You'll see that the tail command in the first window is writing the updates to the terminal as they are entered in the file. Press Ctrl+C to close the tail program. Another trick I use a lot with tail is to use -n +2. This shows everything from the second line - the + symbol indicates we show everything from the given line onwards. This makes it easy to strip the header, or first line, from content. Here's how you might use it: $ head ~/effective-shell/data/top100.csv | tail -n +2\"1\",\"97\",\"Black Panther (2018)\",\"515\"\"2\",\"94\",\"Avengers: Endgame (2019)\",\"531\"\"3\",\"93\",\"Us (2019)\",\"536\"\"4\",\"97\",\"Toy Story 4 (2019)\",\"445\"\"5\",\"99\",\"Lady Bird (2017)\",\"393\"\"6\",\"100\",\"Citizen Kane (1941)\",\"94\"\"7\",\"97\",\"Mission: Impossible - Fallout (2018)\",\"430\"\"8\",\"98\",\"The Wizard of Oz (1939)\",\"120\"\"9\",\"96\",\"The Irishman (2019)\",\"441\" Here I've taken the head of the file (otherwise the output gets quite difficult to follow), then piped the results into tail -n +2 to grab everything from the second line onwards - which removes the heading line. We see the films only, not the titles of each column. We're going to use head and tail quite a lot when working with text.

The first form is used to replace characters. Running: tr ',' '\\n' Replaces the first specified character with the second. The \\n character is the special newline character, which is used to create a line break at the end of a file. The second form uses the -d flag to specify a set of characters to delete: tr -d '\"' In the form above we delete quote (\") characters. When using tr remember that it works on characters. For example, the following might not work as you expect: $ echo \"Welcome to the shell\" | tr 'shell' 'machine'Wcicomc to tac macii The reason the output is like this is that we're specifying character replacements - so we're changing characters as shown below: s -> mh -> ae -> cl -> hl -> i There are plenty of ways to replace entire words or perform more complex operations, but we'll use sed or awk for these operations - which we'll see in the following chapter. There is one final thing it is worth mentioning about tr. It can be provided with character classes. This is easiest to explain with an example: $ echo \"Use your inside voice...\" | tr '[[:lower:]]' '[[:upper:]]'USE YOUR INSIDE VOICE... In this case we are transforming characters in the lower class (lowercase characters) to the upper class (uppercase characters). On Linux systems you can find more about character classes with man 7 regex. I am not going to go deeper into character classes at this stage. They provide a simple way to specify things like digits, alphabetic characters and so on, but there are other ways to do this (with extended regexes) which I think are likely to be more useful to learn about instead.","s":"Replacing Text","u":"/part-3-manipulating-text/slice-and-dice-text/","h":"#replacing-text","p":745},{"i":752,"t":"The next command is one which I've used far more than I expected. The cut command splits a line of text, using a given delimiter. Let's see some examples: $ cut -d',' -f 3 ~/effective-shell/data/top100.csv | head\"Title\"\"Black Panther (2018)\"\"Avengers: Endgame (2019)\"\"Us (2019)\"\"Toy Story 4 (2019)\"\"Lady Bird (2017)\"\"Citizen Kane (1941)\"\"Mission: Impossible - Fallout (2018)\"\"The Wizard of Oz (1939)\"\"The Irishman (2019)\" This is the first way to use cut. We specify the -d flag to choose a delimiter which we will cut the text with, then -f to choose which field we want to see. In this case we show split on the command character and show the third field - the title of the film in the data file. This can be extraordinarily useful. Let's see how to get the names of the Kubernetes pods I have running on a cluster. I can use the following command to get the pods: $ kubectl get podsNAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGEelastic-operator-0 1/1 Running 0 35delk-apm-server-65b698fb8c-rzncz 1/1 Running 0 13delk-es-default-0 1/1 Running 0 35delk-kb-6f8bb6457b-bbbnn 1/1 Running 0 35dfilebeat-beat-filebeat-ccgl7 1/1 Running 1 13dfilebeat-beat-filebeat-dvf2l 1/1 Running 2 13dfilebeat-beat-filebeat-mnpms 1/1 Running 329 13dkube-state-metrics-5cb57bdc45-mqv9d 1/1 Running 0 35dmetricbeat-beat-metricbeat-2xm7t 1/1 Running 6103 35dmetricbeat-beat-metricbeat-96dkt 1/1 Running 6097 35dmetricbeat-beat-metricbeat-n7kxm 1/1 Running 6109 35d Now to get the name I can just cut the lines on the 'space' character and grab the first field: $ kubectl get pods | cut -d' ' -f 1NAMEelastic-operator-0elk-apm-server-65b698fb8c-rznczelk-es-default-0elk-kb-6f8bb6457b-bbbnnfilebeat-beat-filebeat-ccgl7filebeat-beat-filebeat-dvf2lfilebeat-beat-filebeat-mnpmskube-state-metrics-5cb57bdc45-mqv9dmetricbeat-beat-metricbeat-2xm7tmetricbeat-beat-metricbeat-96dktmetricbeat-beat-metricbeat-n7kxm And if we want to strip the first line?

There is another way we can cut text. We can cut by slicing a number of characters from each line. Let's take a look at our web logs file: $ tail ~/effective-shell/logs/web-server-logs.txt2020-11-29T12:50:52.721Z: info - Request: GET /en.search.min.1f83b222e24a227c0f5763727cb9e4f3b435f08b936f6ce529c9c9359f6b61a8.js2020-11-29T12:50:52.722Z: info - Serving file '../../../website/public/en.search.min.1f83b222e24a227c0f5763727cb9e4f3b435f08b936f6ce529c9c9359f6b61a8.js'...2020-11-29T12:50:52.762Z: info - Request: GET /svg/menu.svg2020-11-29T12:50:52.763Z: info - Serving file '../../../website/public/svg/menu.svg'...2020-11-29T12:50:52.763Z: info - Request: GET /svg/calendar.svg2020-11-29T12:50:52.764Z: info - Serving file '../../../website/public/svg/calendar.svg'...2020-11-29T12:50:52.765Z: info - Request: GET /svg/edit.svg2020-11-29T12:50:52.766Z: info - Serving file '../../../website/public/svg/edit.svg'...2020-11-29T12:50:52.784Z: info - Request: GET /fonts/roboto-v19-latin-300italic.woff22020-11-29T12:50:52.785Z: info - Serving file '../../../website/public/fonts/roboto-v19-latin-300italic.woff2'... We can use the -c (characters) flag to specify the characters in the line we want to see. Let's extract the timestamp only: $ tail -n 3 ~/effective-shell/logs/web-server-logs.txt | cut -c 12-1912:50:5212:50:5212:50:52 We can also use the character option to extract everything from a specific point onwards: $ tail -n 3 ~/effective-shell/logs/web-server-logs.txt | cut -c 27-info - Serving file '../../../website/public/svg/edit.svg'...info - Request: GET /fonts/roboto-v19-latin-300italic.woff2info - Serving file '../../../website/public/fonts/roboto-v19-latin-300italic.woff2'... By cutting from the 27th character onwards (-c 27-) we remove the timestamp and just get the log message. As a nice trick you can use the same syntax when splitting by fields: $ tail -n 3 ~/effective-shell/data/top100.csv | cut -d',' -f 3-\"Pinocchio (1940)\",\"55\"\"Chinatown (1974)\",\"75\"\"The Dark Knight (2008)\",\"342\" This is field three onwards.

As we introduce more complex tools later on, like sed and awk, we'll see other ways to accomplish the same goals, but I often find that by filtering down the content with grep first I can cut my way to what I need without having to use more complex tools.","s":"How to Cut","u":"/part-3-manipulating-text/slice-and-dice-text/","h":"#how-to-cut","p":745},{"i":754,"t":"There is a very simple command called rev which reverses the given input.

However, most of them perform functionality which you can get from other tools (such as making the lines unique, which we can do with uniq). You might find some of them useful so don't be shy to explore some of the other options. The uniq command removes duplicate lines from a stream of text. Note that this only removes duplicate lines when they are next to each other. This means that you will often have to sort first. Here's an example of where I might use uniq - getting all unique error messages in a log file: $ cut -c 27- ~/effective-shell/logs/web-server-logs.txt | grep error | sort | uniqerror - Unhandled error EACCES trying to read '../../../website/public/docs/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/5-getting-help/index.html', returning a 500error - Unhandled error EACCES trying to read '../../../website/public/svg/calendar.svg', returning a 500error - Unhandled error EACCES trying to read '../../../website/public/svg/edit.svg', returning a 500info - Request: GET /docs/1-getting-started/images/ls-applications-windows-error.pnginfo - Request: GET /docs/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/3-managing-your-files/images/rm-error-directory.pnginfo - Serving file '../../../website/public/docs/1-getting-started/images/ls-applications-windows-error.png'...info - Serving file '../../../website/public/docs/part-1-transitioning-to-the-shell/3-managing-your-files/images/rm-error-directory.png'...

Don't forget to use your pager when you are working with text. When you are trying to build a pipeline and want to see intermediate results (perhaps before you use head or tail) then you can use the pager to avoid filling your screen and terminal with too much text. For example, when looking at the sorted list of films, I might run this: $ cut -d',' -f 3 ~/effective-shell/data/top100.csv | sort | less \"Jaws (1975)\" \"King Kong (1933)\" \"La Grande illusion (Grand Illusion) (1938)\" \"La La Land (2016)\" \"Lady Bird (2017)\" \"Laura (1944)\" /Jaws I've made the output smaller so that it is easier to see what is happening.

The $HISTFILE environment variable holds the path to the shell command history file. tail -f $HISTFILE uses the -f flag to follow the file, printing output as it is written to the file. tr 'a' 'b' is the translate text command, which turns one set of characters into another tr -d '!' shows how the -d or delete flag can specify characters to delete. The cut command can be used to extract parts of a line of text. cut -d',' -f 3 shows how the -d or delimiter flag is used to specify the delimiter to cut on and how the -f or field flag specifies which of the fields the text has been cut into is printed. cut -c 2-4 uses the -c or characters flag to specify that we are extracting a subset of characters in the line, in this case characters two to four. cut -c 10- cuts from character ten to the end of the line The cut command also allows for multiple fields to be specified when cutting by field, such as -f 2,3 for the second and third field, or -f 4- for fields four onwards. rev reverses text - by reversing, cutting and then re-reversing you can quickly extract text from the end of a line. sort sorts the incoming text alphabetically. The -r flag for sort reverses the sort order. The uniq command removes duplicate lines - but only when they are next to each other, so you'll often use it in combination with sort.

This means it is designed to be used without a mouse, on a smaller screen, and on a system that might have no graphical user interface or windowing or desktop environment. Some of the most popular terminal editors you might have heard of are GNU nano, Vim and Emacs. Let's take a look at why we might want to know how to use a terminal editor.","s":"What is a Terminal Editor","u":"/part-6-advanced-techniques/a-vim-crash-course/","h":"#what-is-a-terminal-editor","p":761},{"i":766,"t":"Many technologists will be familiar with Graphical Text Editors, such as Visual Studio Code, Atom and Sublime. Software engineers will likely be familiar with Integrated Development Environments such as Visual Studio or the JetBrains family of IDEs which include dedicated environments for many languages, such as IntelliJ IDEA for Java. So, with such a selection of powerful and user-friendly text editing options available, why would you choose to use a Terminal Editor? There are many reasons, but perhaps the most compelling one is that you will not always have a graphical environment available! If you are working on a remote server using the ssh tool as described in Chapter 31 - The Secure Shell, you will not have a desktop or windowed environment to run a graphical tool. The only options available for you to edit text, code or scripts in such an environment are terminal editors - because the terminal is your only interface to the server. There are other times where you might not have easy access to a graphical environment - for example if you are editing a file in a Docker container. There are some other reasons that being able to use a terminal editor is powerful: Maintaining flow - if you are working in a shell already and need to edit text, being able to quickly do so without leaving the shell, and ideally without even having to touch the mouse, will allow you to maintain your 'flow' while you work. Speed of editing - editors such as Vim and Emacs allow you to be incredibly efficient at editing text, once you get over the initial learning curve. Vim in particular is designed to try and keep your fingers on the home row of the keyboard as much as possible to make it possible to manipulate text very quickly. Customisation - terminal editors can be customised to suit your working style - you can then manage your customisations through dotfiles that you share across environments as described in Chapter 26 - Managing Your Dotfiles. Improving Efficiency in Graphical Editors and other tools - if you learn how to use Vim or Emacs and find yourself able to edit text very efficiently using their idioms, then you can install plugins in your graphical editors or IDEs, allowing you to edit text using the same commands. There are even browser plugins that let you navigate webpages using Vim style movement commands. All in all I believe it is extremely useful to get to grips with at least the basics of Vim - you will be more efficient when working with remote machines, when quickly editing text from the shell, and might even find it replaces your other tools for many tasks.","s":"Why use a Terminal Editor?","u":"/part-6-advanced-techniques/a-vim-crash-course/","h":"#why-use-a-terminal-editor","p":761},{"i":768,"t":"I have chosen Vim as it has the reputation for being the most complex of the terminal text editors to work with, but actually with an hour or two of practice you'll find that it is quite straightforward to use for simple tasks.

Vim is installed on most Linux distributions out of the box and is an extremely popular editor. But it has a style of editing, called Modal Editing that can be a bit confusing at first.","s":"Introducing Vim","u":"/part-6-advanced-techniques/a-vim-crash-course/","h":"#introducing-vim","p":761},{"i":770,"t":"Vim is a modal text editor. This means that it runs in different 'modes' - and in each mode the keyboard has different functions. For example, when you are in Command Mode the keyboard is used to enter sequences that manipulate text or move the cursor. In Insert Mode your keyboard is used just like with a normal text editor - typing edits the text on the screen.","s":"What is Modal Editing?","u":"/part-6-advanced-techniques/a-vim-crash-course/","h":"#what-is-modal-editing","p":761},{"i":772,"t":"First, we'll open Vim by running the vi command: $ vi█~~~~~ VIM - Vi IMproved~~ version 8.2.4314~ by Bram Moolenaar et al.~ Modified by <bugzilla@redhat.com>~ Vim is open source and freely distributable~~ Help poor children in Uganda!~ type :help iccf<Enter> for information~~ type :q<Enter> to exit~ type :help<Enter> or <F1> for on-line help~ type :help version8<Enter> for version info~~~~~ 0,0-1 All When Vim is started it either displays the file that it has been asked to open or if no file has been provided it shows the welcome message above. Vim starts in Command Mode. This means that the keys on the keyboard are not used to enter text - they are used to enter commands. One command that is going to be useful is the 'insert' command, which tells vim to enter Insert Mode, before the cursor. The position of the cursor in the code block above is shown with a full-block █ symbol. Let's insert some text. Enter the characters in the first column of the table below - the output should match what is shown on the right: Keystrokes Output iEnter insert mode Hello Vim!Enter text Hello Vim! The i command tells Vim to enter Insert Mode. Insert mode is the mode that will be most familiar to you - when Vim is in insert mode your keystrokes enter text in the current file. When Vim is in insert mode it behaves more like a non-modal editor. We can enter some text as shown above. You might have noticed that when you entered insert mode Vim updated its status bar to show you what mode it is in: Hello Vim!█~~~-- INSERT -- 1,11 All Vim will show you what mode you are in on the status line at the bottom of the screen. Vim's default mode is 'Command Mode' - when Vim is in command mode the mode is not shown - it's what you assume Vim is in unless it tells you otherwise. To return to Command Mode, press Control and 'C', or 'Escape'. In Vim's documentation a 'chord', which is more than one key pressed at the same time, is shown in angled brackets, to differentiate it from a 'sequence' which is a set of keystrokes pressed one after the other. Control and C is written as <C-c> in the documentation for Vim. We will use the same style to describe chords and sequences. Let's exit insert mode: Keystrokes Output <C-c>Command mode Hello Vim! You will notice that the -- INSERT -- text in the status bar is no longer shown - meaning we are back in Command Mode. Let's exit Vim. When we are in Command Mode, the keystrokes when enter are used to manipulate text or move around. If we want to perform an administrative task, such as saving a file or calling another program, we use what is called an Ex Command. Ex is short for 'execute'. When we press the colon : keystroke, we enter 'Ex Mode'. This mode is a bit like Insert Mode, but for writing commands: Keystrokes Output :Start ex command : q!Quit without saving :q! Keystrokes we enter after entering Ex mode will show in the status line, showing the text for the command we are building. At this point the status bar for Vim will look like this: Hello Vim!~ ~ ~ :q!█ Vim is showing us that our current command is q!. This command translates to 'quit without saving'. Press the Enter key to execute the command - Vim will now close. We have seen the basics of modal editing - showing Vim's Command Mode, Insert Mode and Ex Mode. We can also close Vim - which is famously a task that people who haven't used Vim before struggle with!

A buffer can be thought of as a view on a file - when we open a file we load the context into a buffer - it is this buffer that Vim shows. When we want to create a new file, we enter text in a new buffer and then save it when we are ready. Vim is showing us in the status line that we have a buffer named cheatsheet.md and that this is a 'New' buffer - it has not been saved. The extension md at the end of the file is short for 'Markdown'. Markdown is a plain text format that is great for documentation. You write text as normal - you can also use some special characters such as Hash # to format things like headings, or dash - for bullets.

The next four motions are hjkl - move left, down, up and right. Vim uses these keys as they are all next to each other and on the home row for the right hand. Although it takes a little getting used to, once you use hjkl instead of arrow keys to move around you'll wonder how you lived without them - being able to navigate without moving your right hand from the home row lets you navigate text incredibly quickly. We can use the 0 and $ motions to go to the beginning and end of a line: Keystrokes Output 0Go to beginning of line ## Vim Motions $Go to end of line ## Vim Motions The w and b motions move backwards and forwards by one word: Keystrokes Output 0Go to beginning of line ## Vim Motions wGo forward one word ## Vim Motions bGo to back one word ## Vim Motions","s":"Vim Motions and Movement Commands","u":"/part-6-advanced-techniques/a-vim-crash-course/","h":"#vim-motions-and-movement-commands","p":761},{"i":780,"t":"Many Vim commands can be provided with a 'count', which indicates how many times the command should be run.

However, Vim has a set of commands that enter Insert Mode in specific positions - and these can save us moving around unnecessarily! The most essential 'enter insert mode' commands are: Command Description i Insert at cursor. I Insert beginning of current line. a Append text after the cursor. A Append text at the end of the current line. o Open a new line below the position. O Open a new line above the current line. These commands make it much faster to quickly enter Insert Mode just where you like.

O<C-c>Open line above current line, enter command mode # Vim Cheatsheet Welcome and Hello Vim We use the <C-c> chord to quickly go back into Command Mode when we have inserted text. This should start to become a habit as you use Vim - it is faster to enter small amounts of text, then go back to command mode and reposition the cursor, than to enter lots of text and use the arrow keys to move around in Insert Mode1.

These operators can also quickly be applied to the current line - just type them twice!

F{character} Find the previous specified character. t{character} 'To' the next specified character. T{character} 'To' the previous specified character.

On many systems dotfiles are hidden by default. This means that they will not show up if you run commands like ls, unless you provide flags such as -a (show all files and folders) flag. In desktop environments such as Gnome, KDE and MacOS X dotfiles are also hidden by default. Dotfiles are often used 'behind the scenes' as configuration files or system files. This is why they are hidden by default - 'normal' users shouldn't have to worry about them or their contents. You will mostly see dotfiles in your HOME directory. They have a dot to mark them as hidden to distinguish them from your personal files and folders. When there are configuration files that are outside your home directory, the dot is normally not used, because it is clear from the folder that the file is in that the file is in that it is a configuration file. As an example, a user's personal Bash configuration is stored in ~/.bashrc, but the global Bash configuration applied to all users is stored in /etc/bash.bashrc. The second configuration file does not need a dot in front of it - the /etc folder is where configuration is kept so there is no need to differentiate it from other files like a user's personal files. Nowadays, when a user says \"my dotfiles\", they typically mean their configuration files that are kept in their home directory. In a sense, your dotfiles are a bit like your personal settings for your computer. On a desktop environment your settings might be things like your theme or wallpaper. For a shell user, you settings will be files like ~/.bashrc for your shell configuration, ~/.ssh/config for your SSH configuration and so on. You will likely change the dotfiles over time to suit your preferences. Let's take a look at some sensible ways to organise and structure your dotfiles so that you can easily see what is your personal configuration, rather than what is the default configuration provided by the system, and easily manage these configurations.","s":"Dotfiles","u":"/part-5-building-your-toolkit/managing-your-dotfiles","h":"#dotfiles","p":805},{"i":810,"t":"On many platforms the default ~/.bashrc file will contain a number of customisations out-of-the-box.

We also are sourcing the ~/.bash_aliases file if it exists. There will likely be a number of other configuration commands that are set in the file, such as setting up the 'auto-completion' feature of Bash. We could add our own customisations to this file, and many people will do so. However it might be better to keep our changes in our own configuration file. This allows us to differentiate between the 'out-of-the-box' configuration and our own personal changes. Let's see how to do that.","s":"The Default Shell Dotfile","u":"/part-5-building-your-toolkit/managing-your-dotfiles","h":"#the-default-shell-dotfile","p":805},{"i":812,"t":"If we keep our shell customisations in our own dotfile, then it is much easier for us to see what are our personal configuration settings rather than the system-provided configuration settings. Also, if we keep these settings in a separate file, it becomes easier to then share this file across different machines. All we need to do is copy it to each machine where we want it, and source it from the ~/.bashrc file. The other great thing about keeping your shell configuration in its own file is that you can then use it for different shells if you want to. Or you can check in the file to see what the type of shell is and then load a configuration specifically for that shell. It is entirely possible (and quite likely) that you will over time build up a collection of many dotfiles - some might be used for the shell, such as a file to set your favourite aliases or functions and some may be for other tools. To keep things organised I'm going to show a technique to manage your dotfiles that I have found useful. You will see this technique, and many similar techniques, used by many people and demonstrated in blogs and so on. As I walk through the process feel free to customise or adapt it to suit your preferences! First, let's start by creating a sensible location for all of our per-user personal configuration files, a folder called ~/dotfiles: mkdir ~/dotfiles Keeping our dotfiles in a single folder will make it easier for us to later on package them up and share them, track changes to them, update them, and so on.","s":"Creating a Dotfiles Folder","u":"/part-5-building-your-toolkit/managing-your-dotfiles","h":"#creating-a-dotfiles-folder","p":805},{"i":814,"t":"Rather than changing the system-provided ~/.bashrc file to contain all of our customisations, let's create our own shell configuration file in the dotfiles folder: touch ~/dotfiles/shell.sh You can call this file whatever you like, it really comes down to preferences. But here are a few points about the name I have suggested: I have not put a dot in front of the name! This is because within the ~/dotfiles folder I don't actually want this file to be hidden - if I am looking in the ~/dotfiles folder I want to see this file I have not used the name of a shell program in this file - this is because I will make this file work with any shell that I regularly use - so whether I am using zsh, bash or sh, this file should still be able to be loaded I have put .sh at the end of the file name - this is not really needed or even common in the world of Linux or Unix, but does make it immediately clear to the reader (or any program that opens the file) that it is a shell script Now let's edit the ~/dotfiles/shell.sh file to add some configuration that might be useful for our shell: # Note: there is no shebang in this script. This script sets my preferred shell# configuration and should be able to be sourced from any Bash-like shell or# from Z shell.# If we are not running interactively do not continue loading this file.case $- in *i*) ;; *) return;;esac We'll start the file with a comment that clearly explains why this file does not have a shebang and that it should be able to be sourced from any Bash-like shell or Z-Shell. Then we perform a quick check on the parameters that the shell was started with (which are available in the special $- parameter) to see if the i (interactive) parameter is set. If the interactive parameter is not set then we call return to stop loading the script. This is standard for shell configuration files - we only change shell configuration when running interactively (otherwise things like aliases that we add could cause shell scripts and other processes that run non-interactively to have unexpected behaviour). Next, let's set our preferred editor: # Set our editor. Some tools use 'VISUAL', some use 'EDITOR'.VISUAL=nanoEDITOR=nano There are two variables are used by the shell and command line programs to run an editor. The first, and original, variable was EDITOR. This was originally often a line mode editor - i.e. a text editor that doesn't take up the whole screen. This was useful in the days of printed output, before screens were used. The VISUAL variable was used to specify the editor that could be used for 'full screen' terminal editing. Some programs use EDITOR and some use VISUAL so it is best to set both. I have used the nano editor in this example as it available on many distributions and is a little easier than vi or emacs, but you can use whatever you like. For my personal dotfiles I use vi. At this stage you can start to go a bit over the top - for example here's an alternative way to set the editor: # Set our preferred editor to the first available editor in the array below.preferred_editors=(nano vi)for editor in ${preferred_editors[@]}; do if command -v \"${editor}\" >/dev/null 2>&1; then # Note that 'VISUAL' can be a full screen terminal editor. On legacy # systems 'EDITOR' was normally a line mode editor but there is # generally no need to differentiate any more. VISUAL=\"$(command -v ${editor})\" EDITOR=\"${VISUAL}\" break fidoneunset editor preferred_editors In this method we specify an array of editors, go through each one, check to see if it exists2, and if it does set it, otherwise we look for the next in the list. This is completely over the top and unnecessary! But the great thing about your dotfiles is - they're yours! If you want to do this, that's absolutely fine. If you want to check to see if Sublime Text is installed and use that, or Visual Studio Code, then that's not a problem - it's your personal configuration so do what works for you! You'll notice that in the ~/effective-shell/dotfiles/shell.sh folder I unset every shell variable after I use it. This is just to clean up after myself and try to leave the environment as pristine as possible after sourcing the file. Another useful option to set is stty -ixon: # Allow us to use Ctrl+S to perform forward search, by disabling the start and# stop output control signals, which are not needed on modern systems.stty -ixon This command tells the terminal driver that we don't need to control transmission with the Ctrl+Q and Ctrl+S commands, meaning we can instead use Ctrl+S to perform a forward search. Now let's set some sensible settings for working with folders: # Set a shell option but don't fail if it doesn't exist!safe_set() { shopt -s \"$1\" >/dev/null 2>&1 || true; }# Set some options to make working with folders a little easier. Note that we# send all output to '/dev/null' as startup files should not write to the# terminal and older shells might not have these options.safe_set autocd # Enter a folder name to 'cd' to it.safe_set cdspell # Fix minor spelling issues with 'cd'.safe_set dirspell # Fix minor spelling issues for commands.safe_set cdable_vars # Allow 'cd varname' to switch directory.# Uncomment the below if you want to be able to 'cd' into directories that are# not just relative to the current location. For example, if the below was# uncommented we could 'cd my_project' from anywhere if 'my_project' is in# the 'repos' folder.# CDPATH=\"~:~/repos\" If we run this script on an older shell, some of these options might not be present. This is why we have created a safe_set function that won't fail if the shopt function fails and will pipe any output to /dev/null. You can use these settings or remove them, it's really up to you. Each one is described below: Setting Description autocd Allows you to simply type a directory name or path and press enter to cd to it. cdspell When running commands like cd dirname, have the shell fix minor typos. dirspell When running commands like cat dirname/test, have the shell fix minor typos. cdable_vars If you create a var like repos=\"$HOME/repos, then cd repos to move into it. I have also left a comment on how you can use the CDPATH shell variable to allow you to cd into relative folders outside of your current path. This option you should be a little careful with as it can be a bit misleading - but you might find it useful. Finally, let's set some common shell history options: # Configure the history to make it large and support multi-line commands.safe_set histappend # Don't overwrite the history file, append.safe_set cmdhist # Multi-line commands are one entry only.PROMPT_COMMAND='history -a' # Before we prompt, save the history.HISTSIZE=10000 # A large number of commands per session.HISTFILESIZE=100000 # A huge number of commands in the file.# HISTCONTROL=\"ignorespace:ignoredup\" # Ignore starting with space or duplicates?# export HISTIGNORE=\"ls:history\" # Any commands we want to not record?# HISTTIMEFORMAT='%F %T ' # Do we want a timestamp for commands? These shell options and variables can be used to fine-tune how the history works. Here's a description of each one: Setting Description shopt -s histappend When we write to the history file, append entries, don't overwrite the old file. shopt -s cmdhist If we have a multi-line command, record it as one entry, not one per line. PROMPT_COMMAND Before we show the PS1 prompt, update the history file. HISTSIZE Store up to 10000 items in the history for the current session. HISTFILESIZE Store up to 100000 items in the history file for all sessions. HISTCONTROL Uncomment to ignore commands that start with a space, or ignore duplicated commands. HISTIGNORE Uncomment to not record certain commands in the history. HISTTIMEFORMAT Uncomment to keep a date and time next to each command in the history file. At this stage we got a sensible set of basic options for our shell, that should work in Bash, or Bash-like shells, as well as Z-Shell. Now let's look at how we could test this file, before we actually source it.","s":"Creating a Shell Dotfile","u":"/part-5-building-your-toolkit/managing-your-dotfiles","h":"#creating-a-shell-dotfile","p":805},{"i":816,"t":"Before we source the shell dotfile during shell startup, we should test that it runs without errors.

Now all we need to do is add the following lines to our ~/.bashrc (or for Z-Shell, ~/.zshrc file): # Source our shell configuration if it exists.[ -r ~/.shell.sh ] && source ~/.shell.sh This command uses the -r (does file exist and is it readable) test to check whether we have a ~/.shell.sh file and if it exists, sources it.

A convention is to have a folder with the letters .d at the end, to differentiate between a single configuration file and a configuration folder. This pattern became popular over the years as individual configuration files became larger and more complex, and operators wanted to be able to spread their configuration across multiple files. Here are some common examples: Configuration File Configuration Directory Notes /etc/crontab /etc/cron.d Configuration for scheduled tasks. /etc/bash_completion /etc/bash_completion.d Configuration for Bash auto-complete. /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d Configuration for super-users. We can follow exactly the same pattern for our shell configuration. Let's say for example that we want to customise our command prompt when we start the shell, we could put the file that contains the definition of the set_ps1 function from the last chapter in our configuration folder. The file will be loaded and then we can use it to set the PS1 variable in our shell configuration. First, let's make a directory to hold our shell configuration files: $ mkdir ~/dotfiles/shell.d Now let's copy over our ~/effective-shell/scripts/set_ps1.sh file: $ cp ~/effective-shell/scripts/set_ps1.sh ~/dotfiles/shell.d Now let's update our shell.sh file to source all of the files in the ~/.shell.d folder: # If we are not running interactively do not continue loading this file.case $- in *i*) ;; *) return;;esac# Source any files in our ~/.shell.d folder.if [ -x ~/.shell.d ]; then for shellfile in ~/.shell.d/*; do [ -r \"$shellfile\" ] && source \"$shellfile\" done unset shellfilefi The new code goes after the test to see whether the shell is interactive. We check to see whether there is a directory that can be searched (using the -x test), and then we loop through each file in the directory. If the file can be read (using the -r test) then we source it. At the end of the shell.sh file we can now call the set_ps1 function to set our theme: # Set the theme. Do not fail if the function doesn't exist.set_ps1 \"debian\" || true Finally, let's create a symlink in our home directory for the shell configuration files: $ ln -sf \"$HOME/dotfiles/shell.d\" \"$HOME/.shell.d\" At this stage we've now successfully created a dotfiles folder to store our configuration, symlinks in our $HOME directory that point to our dotfiles and we have also updated our ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc to load our shell configuration. If you want to see the new links you've created you can run the ls command just like so (I've abbreviated the output to make it more readable): $ ls -al ~ | grep shelllrwxr-xr-x dwmkerr .shell.d -> /home/dwmkerr/dotfiles/shell.dlrwxr-xr-x dwmkerr .shell.sh -> /home/dwmkerr/dotfiles/shell.sh","s":"Sourcing Files from a Folder","u":"/part-5-building-your-toolkit/managing-your-dotfiles","h":"#sourcing-files-from-a-folder","p":805},{"i":822,"t":"The manual steps we performed to setup the links for our dotfiles can be easily run using a shell script.

The multiplexer manages 'sessions' - these sessions run the programs, independently of your shell or terminal. Users can switch between sessions, save them, resume them, or even invite others to join the same session to allow collaboration. Multiplexers also normally offer 'window management' capabilities, allowing you to break your terminal into separate panes, tabs or windows. The visual below shows a multiplexer in action - the one I am using while I write this chapter: In this image I am running the Tmux multiplexer in my terminal. I have split the window into three panes - a large one on the left that contains the text for the chapter, and two smaller ones on the right. The upper right pane builds the effective shell website locally while I write, to check for errors, and the lower right contains a script I was working on. When I want to switch between the tasks I'm working on, I don't need to start or stop any of the program, I can just switch between the 'panes' in my multiplexer. At the bottom of the screen there are also two tabs - one that contains the website and the windows I'm currently working in, and another that has some windows for the manuscript for the book. If I close my shell, the Tmux server is still running the sessions and I can re-open my terminal and resume. If I was to close my computer, when I restart my multiplexer will restart these programs for me, allowing me to pick up where I left off.","s":"What is a Terminal Multiplexer?","u":"/part-6-advanced-techniques/master-the-multiplexer/","h":"#what-is-a-terminal-multiplexer","p":825},{"i":830,"t":"It is not essential to know how to use a multiplexer. But knowing how to use one can certainly help you become a more effective shell user. Some of the key benefits to using a multiplexer are: Window Management Much like modern 'tabbed interfaces', multiplexers can support multiple windows, tabs and panes within a window. This means you can arrange your workspace exactly how you want it. You can save the configuration of your windows and use it later. You can organise different windows into different sessions, allowing you to have many projects running at once, that you can quickly switch between, each one with a layout configured to suit your needs. Persistence of Sessions Your programs are run independently from your terminal. If your terminal crashes, or freezes, your programs still run. If you are working with a remote machine, then you can run a multiplexer on it to manage your programs. This means that if your connection to the machine is reset, the programs will not stop running. You can re-attach to the session at later point and pick up where you left off. Session management is incredibly useful - you'll wonder how you lived without it if you use the shell a lot. Configuration Multiplexers offer many configuration options to allow you to customise how programs are run and interfaced with, allowing you to set up the ideal environment for you to be effective. Collaboration A multiplexer is a 'client-server' program. This means you as a user are a client and connect to a server that runs the multiplexer. But other users can connect as well - this means you can easily collaborate with other users, sharing your own work, connecting to theirs, or both working on a shared remote machine. We'll look at a few of the most immediately useful features of multiplexers in this chapter - this will only really be scratching the surface but should be enough to help you decide whether it is a topic you'll investigate further on your own and add to your toolkit.","s":"Why use a Multiplexer?","u":"/part-6-advanced-techniques/master-the-multiplexer/","h":"#why-use-a-multiplexer","p":825},{"i":832,"t":"The two most popular multiplexers are probably GNU screen and Tmux. GNU screen was created in the late 80s and has been used widely ever since. It is pre-installed on many Linux systems. Tmux is a more modern multiplexer, created in 2007. It has most of the features of GNU screen, is also open source, and adds some very useful features to make it a little more user friendly. For the rest of this chapter we are going to look at Tmux in detail. I've chosen Tmux rather than screen because I think its user-friendliness makes it a little better for people who are new to multiplexers. Once you are familiar with Tmux you might decide to switch to GNU screen - if so it will seem very familiar.","s":"Introducing Screen and Tmux","u":"/part-6-advanced-techniques/master-the-multiplexer/","h":"#introducing-screen-and-tmux","p":825},{"i":834,"t":"Tmux may already be installed on your system.

Install Tmux with the package manager for your system. The package name on most distributions is just tmux.

The leader is a key combination that prefixes any commands for the multiplexer. We just this leader combination so that the multiplexer key bindings don't clash with any existing ones. Typically you will use the leader keys to tell the multiplexer you are about to enter a command, then strike the keys that correspond to the command. For Tmux, the default leader is Ctrl + B. For GNU screen it is Ctrl + A. You can easily remember these by remembering that Tmux is a successor to GNU screen, so the leader key letter is one letter further in the alphabet!","s":"The Leader","u":"/part-6-advanced-techniques/master-the-multiplexer/","h":"#the-leader","p":825},{"i":840,"t":"Run the tmux program by entering the command below: tmux We are now going to create some 'splits' - these will split our current window into separate panes. Each pane can run its own program. Let's take a look at a few commands for managing splits and panes. Creating Splits and Moving Between Splits​ We can create a vertical split by pressing Ctrl+B followed by the % percent symbol. We can create a horizontal split by pressing Ctrl+B followed by the \" quotes symbol. Finally, to move between splits, press Ctrl+B followed by an arrow key. The short video demonstrates both types of split and moving between panes: Zooming Panes​ You can 'zoom' a pane so that it takes up the entire window by moving to the pane you want to zoom and pressing Ctrl+b z. To 'unzoom' a pane, you can just move to another pane (even if it is hidden) or simply press Ctrl+B z again. This what it looks like when we zoom a pane: Creating Windows and Moving Between Windows​ If you want to run a program in an entirely new window, use the Ctrl+b c command to create a window. To switch windows, press Ctrl+b w to choose from the list of available windows: Quickly Navigating Between Windows​ The ^B w command shows all of the windows (and sessions!) for Tmux and let's you rapidly switch between them, this is extremely useful if you have a lot of windows! Here's how it looks in action - in this demo I have a few windows - notice that I've given them more clear names with ^B ,, this also makes it easier to sort and manage your windows. Quick Reference​ There are some other useful commands when working with windows: Command Description ^b n Move to the next window ^b p Move to the previous window ^b 0 Select the window numbered '0' - use the number of any window from the status pane ^b & Close the current window ^b , Rename the current window ^b w Show the window navigator The 'rename window' is very useful if you have a lot of windows and want to give each one a descriptive name. Remember, Tmux is stateful so will remember these settings even if you detached and later re-attach (we'll see this in the next section).","s":"Window Management","u":"/part-6-advanced-techniques/master-the-multiplexer/","h":"#window-management","p":825},{"i":842,"t":"Sessions in Tmux are a collection of independently managed windows. They are great for creating lots of 'projects' - each session can be a project with the appropriate windows for the work you are doing. Let's start Tmux, but name the session effective-shell by using the tmux new -s effective-shell command. Once we've done this, we'll create a couple of windows, then create a new session by using Ctrl+b :. This command opens the Tmux command pane which is shown at the bottom of the screen. This command pane allows us to run a Tmux command. When we do this, we don't need to put tmux at the beginning. Let's create a second session named my-project. We can now switch between sessions with Ctrl+b s. This opens the list of sessions and lets us select one using the arrow keys. Tmux gives us a preview of each session as we move the selection over them. The commands we will run are below. Remember, ^B means 'Control B', i.e. hold the Ctrl key and press 'b': # Create a new tmux session with the name 'effective shell'.tmux new -s effective-shell# Create a new Window.^B c# Enter tmux command mode.^B :# Create a second session.new -s my-project# Select from the list of sessions.^B s We can see visually what this looks like below:","s":"Session Management","u":"/part-6-advanced-techniques/master-the-multiplexer/","h":"#session-management","p":825},{"i":844,"t":"The great thing about sessions is that we can set them up, then detach from them to do other work. The sessions will keep running and we can re-attach to them later. This means you can close your terminal and re-open it and programs will still run. If we are in the shell and want to open Tmux and attach to whatever was the last session, we can just run: tmux attach When we are in a Tmux session, we can detach from it by entering command mode with Ctrl+B : and using the detach command: ^B :detach We could close our terminal at this point - the sessions are persisted by the Tmux server. Now if we re-open a terminal, we can re-attach with the same command as before: tmux attach A video of how this looks is below: If you use Tmux a lot you might find you end up with lots of sessions - you can delete sessions by pressing ^B s to show the session list, scroll to the session you want to delete and just press x. Tmux will ask for confirmation before it closes the session. Some useful shortcuts for sessions are: Sessions are extremely powerful for organising your work.

However, if you find yourself using Tmux a lot you might want to look at some of the configuration options available to help you fine-tune the program to suit your preferences. Tmux follows a very standard Unix-style configuration pattern - a dotfile is used to configure the program. If you are not familiar with dotifles, check Chapter 26 - Managing Your Dotfiles - this chapter also goes into detail on how you can version control and save your dotfiles as well as share them across many machines easily. To configure Tmux, create a file named .tmux.conf in your home directory: touch ~/.tmux.conf Now open this file in your preferred editor. As we have just created it there will be nothing in the file. There are a raft of configuration options available, you can check the manpages with man tmux to see details, or search for any of the excellent online guides on how to configure Tmux. I'll share what I think are some of the most useful configuration options for Tmux1. Let's add some configuration options, I'll explain each as we go along. The Default Shell The first thing I do is to tell Tmux to use my current shell program. This means if I am using Z-Shell, Tmux will open windows with Z-Shell. If I am using Bash, it will use Bash. It will also source my shell dotfiles, so that each window that is opened has the same PS1 and configuration as my standard shell. # Set the default shell, and set the default command to use our shell (this# means we source things properly, show the correct PS1 etc).set -g default-shell ${SHELL}set -g default-command ${SHELL} Open windows in the Working Directory By default when you create a new window with ^B c, Tmux will set the working directory of the window to the home directory. In general I prefer to have the window open in my current working directory: # Open new panes and splits in the same working directory.bind c new-window -c \"#{pane_current_path}\" Stable window names and sequential windows Tmux will try to be smart and change the name of each window to the program it is currently running. This means window names change as you use them. I find this distracting, so disable the automatic renaming of windows - in general I rename a window as soon as I have opened it with ^B , and give it a descriptive name. I also set Tmux to start windows from number 1 rather than 0, and when windows are created or deleted ensure that Tmux re-numbers them so that they are sequential, without gaps. If you don't do this you'll rapidly find yourself running into windows with double-digit numbers which are harder to select (you can only use ^B <window-number to select windows 0 through 9): # Set the name of the window initially, but then don't let tmux change it.# The name can still be set at any time with Ctrl+B + ,set-option -g allow-rename off# Start windows and panes at 1.set -g base-index 1set -g pane-base-index 1# When we add/remove windows, renumber them in sequential order.set -g renumber-windows on Sensible Splitting Commands I've always found ^B % and ^B \" odd commands to split, and still to this day regularly mix them up. So I use ^B - to make a vertical split and ^B | t make a horizontal split. The direction of the bar, either the hyphen or vertical bar I find much easier as a way to remember what kind of split I'll be making! # Split panes using | and -bind | split-window -h -c \"#{pane_current_path}\"bind - split-window -v -c \"#{pane_current_path}\" Nested Session Leaders I am almost never not in a Tmux session. This means that if I open a nested session, for example by ssh-ing into a virtual machine that and running Tmux there, I have trouble sending commands to the nested Tmux - if I use ^b c to open a new window for example, it'll open the window on my machine, not in the nested session. By using bind-key v send-prefix I can use ^b b to send a command to the nested session. This might sound fiddly but we'll see how useful it is in the next section! # Use ^b b to send the leader to a nested session. This means if you are# using tmux and then ssh into a tmux session (i.e. a nested session) you# can run commands in the nested session with ^B b <command>.bind-key b send-prefix Mouse Support If you have a mouse, which will normally be the case if you are working with your local machine, then you can enable the mouse for Tmux, allowing you to drag panes to resize them, select panes and windows with the mouse and so on. If you are feeling like you want to really get your 'mouseless' flow working - disable this option! It'll force you to learn the commands. # Enable mouse mode (tmux 2.1 and above)set -g mouse on Vim Mode! I set a number of configuration options to help Tmux interface more seamlessly with Vim, and also use Vim directions rather than arrow keys to move around. This means I use ^B j to go to the pane below, ^B l to go to the pane to the right. I have also configured a number of keybindings to make resizing panes a little more intuitive to a Vim user, as well as keybindings for Vim style selection of text. These are more advanced options and only going to be of interest to Vim users however, so I'll let you explore them if you are interested in my dotfiles project at github.com/dwmkerr/dotfiles","s":"Configuration","u":"/part-6-advanced-techniques/master-the-multiplexer/","h":"#configuration","p":825},{"i":848,"t":"We have really only touched the most basic of configuration options.

This is great for organising your local work. But you can run Tmux on another machine or server, then connect to it from your machine. This is another quite advanced topic, but to show just how powerful this can be, the video below demonstrates some of Tmux's features and how they can make working across many machines so much easier. In this video, the following actions are performed: We start a local Tmux session with tmux We split the window, giving us space to open a secure shell, using ^b % In our new split, we ssh onto the box we created in Chapter 31 - The Secure Shell On this box, we start a new Tmux session In this Tmux session we start creating a new Python script Now we connect to this session from our local machine over ssh using ssh -t effective-shell-aws-linux tmux attach This attaches us to our session on the server - and we're in Vim ready to work on the script! To complete the demo, I connect from another machine, my Macbook - and then edit the script live In this demo we have two separate machines connecting to our server, able to collaborate real-time on a Tmux session that will persist even if we shut down the machines we are connecting from. This just touches the surface of what is possible! In this example we used the command ssh -t effective-shell-aws-linux tmux attach. The ssh program allows you to run a command on the server. The command we are running is tmux attach. Now by default if we ask ssh to run a command it will not connect the input of our terminal to the server - the idea is that sometimes we are just using ssh to run one-off commands and don't need to stay connected. But for this command we actually want to stay attached to the server, so we use the -t request tty` flag to attach our terminal input to the SSH session. You can setup your SSH config file to automatically attach to the Tmux session. This is how my ~/.ssh/config file entry is setup for the virtual machine we created in Chapter 31 - The Secure Shell: Host effective-shell-aws-linux HostName ec2-13-213-71-135.ap-southeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com User ec2-user IdentityFile ~/.ssh/effective-shell RequestTTY yes # ensure that we attach our terminal input RemoteCommand tmux attach # attach to the tmux session This configuration means that when we SSH onto the effective-shell-aws-linux box we will run the tmux attach command and attach our terminal.

It is a protocol that has been used for decades as a way to establish a secure connection to a remote machine, on your network or across the internet. The program named ssh is the 'secure shell' - it is a program that helps you establish SSH connections, manage credentials, and open a shell on a remote machine. When you connect to a remote machine, you will typically have to authenticate. It is possible to authenticate with a username and password. In most scenarios however you will have to use Asymmetric Encryption to authenticate with the server. Asymmetric encryption uses special 'keys', called 'public keys' and 'private keys' to manage authentication and secure data. This might be new to you if you are used to using simple authentication protocols such as username and password. But public/private key based security is extremely secure and a great thing to know about! So let's start by looking at how public and private keys work and then create our own key pair which we will later use to secure our connections.","s":"What is SSH?","u":"/part-6-advanced-techniques/the-secure-shell/","h":"#what-is-ssh","p":859},{"i":864,"t":"The details of symmetric and asymmetric encryption complex and beyond the scope of this book1.

If a user 'Alice' wants to send a message to another user, 'Bob', we have to share the secret so that Bob can decrypt the message that Alice sends: The diagram above is a hugely simplified view, but essentially shows that when the users want to exchange a message they both need to know the secret - one user uses the secret to encrypt the message, the other uses the same secret to decrypt it. When you connect to a remote machine using symmetric authentication, you are the client (Alice) and the machine is the server (Bob). Now in reality there are ways to obscure and protect this secret somewhat, but no matter how many clever tricks are used, we are still in the situation where the recipient has sensitive data - the user's secret. This is actually quite problematic because it means if we don't trust this user, or their machine or environment, we might not want to share a secret.","s":"Symmetric Encryption for Authentication","u":"/part-6-advanced-techniques/the-secure-shell/","h":"#symmetric-encryption-for-authentication","p":859},{"i":868,"t":"When we use asymmetric encryption, Alice first creates a 'key pair'. This is two files - a public key and a private key. Alice keeps the private key and sends the public key to Bob: Now that Bob has the public key, he creates a secret that only he knows and then encrypts it with Alice's public key. He then sends this secret to Alice. The secret was encrypted by Alice's Public Key - meaning only the associated Private Key can decrypt it. This means even if someone intercepts the secret they cannot decrypt it! Only Alice can, as only Alice has the private key: Now Alice has Bob's secret and only she can decrypt it. Once she decrypts it both she and Bob have a shared secret - that no one has been able to intercept. They can now use Symmetric Encryption to exchange messages, safe in the knowledge that the secret is kept just between them. The fantastic thing about this mechanism is that only Alice can decrypt messages encrypted with her public key. Alice can keep her key private. Her public key is not sensitive - it can only be used to encrypt messages for Alice. Alice can also encrypt messages with her Private Key - anyone who has the Public Key can decrypt them. This means that this is not a secure way to encrypt a message - but it is a very good way to sign a message. Given that only Alice has the private key, only she can encrypt messages with it. This means if she sends a message encrypted with her private key anyone who has the public key can decrypt it to assert it was sent by Alice - she's the only person with the private key. This method of signing messages with the Private Key is not used to keep the message private but instead to verify the identity of the sender. Most modern day cryptography protocols are based on this technique. In many of them Bob will not actually send back a secret - instead he'll generate his own key-pair and return the Public Key. This is called a 'key exchange'. Almost all modern day encryption is built on this mechanism - when you open a secure connection to a website, an exchange of keys is made between you and the server2. When we use the secure shell to communicate with a remote machine, we will give the remote machine our public key, and we will encrypt our communications with the private key. This is essential because other users might have access to the remote machine - we don't want them seeing our sensitive data such as passwords or private keys. Let's look at how to create a key-pair now.","s":"Asymmetric Encryption for Authentication","u":"/part-6-advanced-techniques/the-secure-shell/","h":"#asymmetric-encryption-for-authentication","p":859},{"i":870,"t":"We can use the ssh-keygen (OpenSSH authentication key utility) to create a key pair.

We will move to the ~/.ssh folder first, which is where users often store their SSH keys: cd ~/.sshssh-keygen -m PEM When you run this command, it will ask you where you would like to save the file: Generating public/private rsa key pair.Enter file in which to save the key (/home/dwmkerr/.ssh/id_rsa): I suggest that you use the default location (the ~/.ssh folder), but name the key pair 'effective-shell': Enter file in which to save the key (/home/dwmkerr/.ssh/id_rsa): effective-shellEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): At this point you will be asked to provide an optional passphrase. We will leave this blank as we are not going to use the server or key for any particularly sensitive data. However, if you are creating keys that will encrypt sensitive data you should definitely add a passphrase. If you add a passphrase, you'll be required to enter each time you load the key. This adds a layer of security - if someone steals your private key they would have to know the passphrase to open it. Once you have skipped the passphrase and passphrase confirmation by pressing the enter key twice, you'll see the final output: Your identification has been saved in effective-shellYour public key has been saved in effective-shell.pubThe key fingerprint is:SHA256:HcqIl3ZhRz9jvhYO3g64FEYT3mAoDc6P4mnh4aKuY08 dwmkerr@macbookThe key's randomart image is:+---[RSA 3072]----+| .o .+ . || o. oo = . || o. * + = || + * * + o || + o * S o o || + = o o + + o ||. *E o o = ||o+. . . + ||*o.. . . |+----[SHA256]-----+ The randomart shown is designed to provide a more user-friendly way to identify a key - if you have many keys you can see the randomart for each to pick the one you want.

It is annoying when this happens - often the shell is so unresponsive that you cannot even free it by pressing ^D or ^C. There is actually an escape sequence that you can use to end a broken session, which is the Enter then ~ then .. In Chapter 33 - Master the Multiplexer we'll look at some great ways to improve upon this, for now if you forget the Enter/Tidle/Dot escape sequence the easiest thing to do is to close your terminal program. When you disconnect from your SSH session, the commands you are running will be terminated. This is because your shell will send the 'hang up' signal.

As a teaser for when you might want to use some of these techniques, consider the diagram below: In this scenario we have two hosts, host1.myproject and host2.myproject in a private part of a network, that is not open to the internet. To access these hosts, we use a 'jump box' or 'bastion' - a host that is running in a part of the network that is accessible to external users. We carefully control access to this box and use it as way to connect to the private host. Now you could SSH onto the bastion, and then SSH onto either of the hosts. But you can speed this process up by setting your ~/.ssh/config like so: Host bastion HostName bastion.myproject.com IdentityFile ~/.ssh/myproject.pem ForwardAgent yesHost *.myproject ProxyJump bastion With this configuration we can connect to either of the private hosts by simply using the ssh command with the host name: ssh host1.internal The ssh program recognises that host1.internal matches the patter *.myproject from our configuration file. It then sees that we have set the ProxyJump option, which instructs ssh to connect through another host. The other host is the bastion, which is accessible to the user, and has the key specified. We also tell the bastion that it should have its authentication forwarded, so that our private key is used when connecting to the host in the private network (without this option when we connect to the bastion we will not have our keys accessible). This network configuration is very common and you can see the SSH configuration file supports quickly and conveniently configuring the SSH agent to use the bastion.

As a quick and dirty way to solve a simple problem, they often cannot be beat. When you combine bring in powerful tools that are built in on most systems such as awk (which can perform advanced text manipulation) they can be even more powerful. But there are reasons you might want to avoid using a shell script: If the problem you are solving is quite complex, the script will be large and hard to manage Shell scripts become hard for others to reason about when they become complex Shell scripts are limited to the features of the shell and the tools on your system - but not every system has the same tools, so complex scripts may not be portable Shell scripts are sometimes the only sensible tool to use, for example if we wanted to write a script that showed the shell's options and let the user toggle them on and off, a script would be ideal. This is because another technology, such as a Python script, would not know what shell you are using. This would make the Python script needlessly complex. But in general, as soon as a script gets to more than about a page of code, I tend to think that this a good point at which to consider using an alternative tool.","s":"When should you avoid shell scripting?","u":"/part-6-advanced-techniques/how-to-avoid-scripting/","h":"#when-should-you-avoid-shell-scripting","p":893},{"i":898,"t":"There are hundreds of programming languages that exist to help you solve technical problems. But not all of them are ideal as an alternative to a shell script. Some of the questions you might ask are: Is the programming language going to be available on almost any machine? Simple shell scripts run almost anywhere without having to install other tools - will the language give me this functionality? Is the language designed for handling the kind of problem I want to solve? Does it support console based input and output? Is it easy to write shell-style tools in this language? Is the language simple and popular? Can others understand or adapt the script without too much intervention? Some languages jump to mind as good options for shell scripts: Python - it is installed by default on almost every system, highly popular, simple to use and read and works well to write input-processing-output programs. Ruby - again, installed on many systems by default. This is a simple language and also highly popular, but perhaps less well-known than Python. C - most platforms have a C compiler installed, and C is great for working with low-level system libraries. But it requires compilation, may behave quite differently on different systems, and is fairly complex for others to use. NodeJS - Node.js uses Javascript as its language, which is highly popular. It is event-driven, meaning it can be very fast. But the version installed across systems varies considerably, and this can cause headaches when sharing scripts. Perl - installed almost universally on any system, very powerful, but possibly less well known nowadays and therefore perhaps less likely to be understood by others. Now when you are writing complex tools or programs, the criteria will change, you want to use a language and platform that really suits the problem you are solving, or is used already by the team you are working with. But in this chapter we're looking at alternatives to shell scripts to write tool that work well when used in the shell. Given it's almost universal presence on systems, its huge (and increasing) popularity, and robust standard library (which allows you to use many features without having to have users download additional packages), Python is an excellent choice for writing shell friendly tools.","s":"What are the alternatives?","u":"/part-6-advanced-techniques/how-to-avoid-scripting/","h":"#what-are-the-alternatives","p":893},{"i":900,"t":"When we are writing a tool that is aimed at shell users, it makes sense to follow the conventions set by other shell tools. This means that users will be able to use the tool in a familiar way, and complement it by combining it with existing tools on their system. So what makes a shell-friendly tool? Being able to read from standard input - this allows us to pipe inputs from other tools into our programs (see Thinking in Pipelines for more on this), we also want to read and process line-by-line, in case the input is very large Being able to write to standard output - this sounds obvious, but it means making sure that our output can be read by a human operator, but also ideally be processed by other tools such as cut, sed, rev and so on, it also means thinking about how colour will or will not be used in output, and avoiding superfluous output that might make it harder to process the output (such as titles, version numbers and so on) Being able to specify options using sensibly defined flags - there are many common conventions for how flags or parameters work in tools, using these patterns (rather than inventing our own) will make our tool easier to use. For example, having an -h flag to show help is a very common convention1 Being able to run on different systems - shell users are used to being able to use tools like grep, sed and so on in a similar way across platforms, a well-written tool will do the same Handling errors using shell idioms - shell-friendly tools use 0 as a status code to indicate success, and define error codes in their documentation, so that people using the tools know how to handle exceptional circumstances There are many other conventions and ideas that could be added, but these are some of the fundamentals.","s":"What makes a shell-friendly tool?","u":"/part-6-advanced-techniques/how-to-avoid-scripting/","h":"#what-makes-a-shell-friendly-tool","p":893},{"i":902,"t":"As an example of how to write a shell-friendly tool, we're going to create a simple program that takes a list of words and provides a definition loaded from the free and fantastic Free Dictionary API. This is a good example of a tool that would be overly complex to write with a shell script. We need to handle input, parse and process it, make HTTP requests to download pages from the internet, parse and process those requests, format the output, and provide some options for the user on how the output looks. A highly experienced shell programmer would likely be able to create this tool with a shell script without breaking a sweat, but it would likely be quite hard for a less experienced user to follow. Python is easy to write and read, has a wealth of online learning resources, and is available on almost any platform. Our requirements for the tool will be quite simple: Allow the user to provide a set of words to be looked up as a text file or from standard input Download the definition of the words Write the words to standard output, with the option to format how this output looks Offer help to the user on how to use the tool We'll also limit ourselves to 'raw' Python using only the standard library - meaning users will not have to install any packages to make this tool work. Help! I don't know Python! That's OK! All of the chapters in the section 'Advanced Techniques' will likely stretch you and require some additional learning and experimentation. Don't worry if you don't know Python - I'll explain as much as I can as I go through the chapter. You should be able to take away the key lessons to be learnt without a particular familiarity with the language. Each of the files you'll see in this section are in the ~/effective-shell/programs/lookup folder.

There are two versions of Python that are commonly used. Python 3 is the current latest version and should be preferred. This is what we will use. Python 2 is still used by many people, and a lot of existing code is written in Python 2, but where possible Python 2 code should be upgraded to Python 3. Python 2 official went out of support in January 2020. Check Python 3 is installed by running: % python3 --versionPython 3.9.10 In general I would recommend that you explicitly make it clear you are using Python 3 by using the python3 tool. On many systems the python tool points to python3, but it is safer to by explicit and use python3. If Python is not installed If you see a message such as command not found: python3, then you will need to install Python. Shell tools take input, process it and produce output. So let's take our structure and create a first cut. This first cut will not perform any processing - it'll just take the input and produce simple output. But it will give us a working starting point to incrementally add more features to. At this stage I'll share the code in the form of snippets - you can see the code as it evolves by looking in the ~/effective-shell/programs/lookup/ folder. lookup-v1.py import sys# Read standard input until there is nothing left to read.while True: # Read a line of input. word = sys.stdin.readline() # If the user hits 'Ctrl+D' to end transmission, readline returns an # empty string and we can stop reading. if not word: break # If the input is an empty line or whitespace, skip it. if word.isspace(): continue # Add the word to our list of lookups, and strip any whitespace from the # beginning and end of it. For now, we don't have a definition. word = word.strip() definition = '' # Write the result. print(\"{} - {}\".format(word, definition)) Let's test this out and then we'll dissect the code. First, we'll just run the program, type some words, then press Ctrl D to signal end-of-transmission (check Thinking In Pipelines if you need a reminder on what 'end-of-transmission' means). You can also press Ctrl C to close the program. $ python3 ~/effective-shell/programs/lookup/lookup-v1.pyoneone -twotwo -threethree - The program successfully reads our input, and writes out a result for each word. We can also test that the program can receive input piped from a file: $ cat ~/effective-shell/data/words.txt | python3 ~/effective-shell/programs/lookup/lookup-v1.pylouche -liana -lieder -Manchu -Nankeen -naevi -Ness - So we have a program that can read from standard input, either interactively or from a file. Let's break down the code section by section. First we create a loop that will run continuously, reading lines from standard input: lookups = []while True: # Read a line of input. word = sys.stdin.readline() If the input is completely empty, then that means we've reached the end of the file or the user has signaled 'end-of-transmission' by pressing Ctrl+D: if not word: break if word.isspace(): continue If the input is just whitespace, such as a newline or tab, we skip it. Now we record the value of the word with the whitespace that might surround it stripped, note that has not been found and set the definition of the word to an empty string: word = word.strip() definition = '' Now we write out the word and its definition: print(\"{} - {}\".format(word, definition)) Now let's look at actually downloading the definition.","s":"Version 1 - Basic Structure","u":"/part-6-advanced-techniques/how-to-avoid-scripting/","h":"#version-1---basic-structure","p":893},{"i":906,"t":"Now that we've got the list of words, we can try and download a definition of each one by using the excellent https://dictionaryapi.dev/ website. This site searches a number of online dictionaries, including Wiktionary. We will add a new function to the script. You can see the complete script in the file ~/effective-shell/programs/lookup/lookup-v2.py. The new function downloads the definition of a word from the dictionaryapi.dev site: lookup-v2.py def search_for_word(word): # Encode the word for HTML. encoded_word = urllib.parse.quote(word.encode('utf8')) # Try and download the definition using the amazing dictionaryapi.dev site. try: url = \"https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/{}\".format(encoded_word) response = urllib.request.urlopen(url) if response.status == 404: print(\"NOT FOUND\") sys.exit(1) with urllib.request.urlopen(url) as response: raw_json_data = response.read().decode('utf-8') # If the word is not found, return an empty definition. except urllib.error.HTTPError as http_error: if http_error.code == 404: return '' raise # Now try and parse the data. data = json.loads(raw_json_data) first_definition = data[0]['meanings'][0]['definitions'][0]['definition'] # Return the result. return first_definition I'm not going to go through this blow-by-blow, it's a fairly rough and ready way to try and get the definition of a word from an online resource. In a nutshell it does the following: Make sure that have the right address to search for the word Search for the word and download the result If the word is not found, return an empty result If the word is found, try and decode the definition and return it With this new function, we can update the main loop of our program to look like this: lookup-v2.py # Strip whitespace from the word and find the definition. word = word.strip() stripped_word = word.strip() definition = search_for_word(stripped_word) # Write the result. print(\"{} - {}\".format(word, definition)) If we pass some test words into the program our output looks like this: $ cat ~/effective-shell/data/words.txt | python3 ~/effective-shell/programs/lookup/lookup-v2.pylouche - To make (an alcoholic beverage, e.g. absinthe or ouzo) cloudy by mixing it with water, due to the presence of anethole. This is known as the ouzo effect.liana - A climbing woody vine, usually tropical.lieder - An art song, sung in German and accompanied on the piano.Manchu -Nankeen - A type of cotton cloth originally from Nanking in China.naevi - A pigmented, raised or otherwise abnormal area on the skin. Naevi may be congenital or acquired, and are always benign.Ness - A promontory; a cape or headland. (Frequently used as a suffix in placenames.) Pretty cool - our program can find a reasonable definition for most of the words in the test data set we have. Now let's look at cleaning up the output.","s":"Version 2 - Downloading the Definition","u":"/part-6-advanced-techniques/how-to-avoid-scripting/","h":"#version-2---downloading-the-definition","p":893},{"i":908,"t":"Our program is working quite well, but we can improve on it by making the output a little friendlier to read. We can show the word in a different colour to the definition, separate the definition with a colon which will make it easier for us to process it with other tools, or even limit the length of the definition so that it fits on the screen. We're also going to let the user provide a 'crop' value if they want to. This is a number that limits the length of the output each line, which could be useful if the user wants to fit the definitions on the screen without them spilling over to the next line. There is a special module in Python called argparse that helps you parse the arguments for a program, we'll use this to specify and parse the 'crop' argument. You can see the complete script in the file ~/effective-shell/programs/lookup/lookup-v3.py. import argparseparser = argparse.ArgumentParser()parser.add_argument( '-c', '--crop', help='crop the output line length', type=int, nargs='?', const=80, # Default value if -c is supplied default=None) # Default value if -c is not suppliedargs = parser.parse_args() The argparse module is very sophisticated, you can read more about it online if you'd like to discover more. But for now, it's enough to know that this code defines an optional argument named crop, that can be provided with a number, or without a number. We'll see it in action shortly. Next we'll add a function that writes a word and its definition in a nicer way: def write_definition(word, definition): # Check if stdout is a terminal - if it is we'll colour the output. is_terminal = sys.stdout.isatty() # We will separate the word and the definition with a colon and space. separator = \": \" # If the 'crop' argument is set, use it. if args.crop: output_length = len(word) + len(separator) + len(definition) if output_length > args.crop: # We need to chop some letters off the end of the definition, but # leave space for '...' to indicate the output is cropped. new_length = len(definition) - 3 - (output_length - args.crop) definition = definition[:new_length] + '...' # If we are in a terminal make the word green and the separator white. if is_terminal: word = \"\\033[92m\" + word + \"\\033[0m\" separator = \"\\033[37m\" + separator + \"\\033[0m\" # Write out the word, separator and definition. print(word + separator + definition) This code first checks to see whether stdout is a terminal. This is useful because if we are in a terminal, we can show colour codes, but if the output is something like a file, we can skip the colour codes (which would look messy in the resulting file). Then we do some arithmetic if the crop argument is provided, shortening the definition if needed. The weird looking characters such as /033[92m are ANSI control codes to set the colour of the output - you can read all about them in Useful Patterns for Shell Scripts in the section 'Colouring Output'. With this function added, and called in the right place in our program, we can now lookup definitions, have the output printed in colour, and specify a 'crop' value: $ cat ./effective-shell/data/words.txt | python3 ./effective-shell/programs/lookup/lookup-v3.py -c 60louche: To make (an alcoholic beverage, e.g. absinthe or ...liana: A climbing woody vine, usually tropical.lieder: An art song, sung in German and accompanied on th...Manchu:Nankeen: A type of cotton cloth originally from Nanking i...naevi: A pigmented, raised or otherwise abnormal area on ...Ness: A promontory; a cape or headland. (Frequently used ... The nice thing about using the argparse module is that our program automatically gets a --help or -h option that can be used to provide instructions: $ python3 ./samples/programs/lookup/lookup-v3.py -husage: lookup-v3.py [-h] [-c [CROP]]optional arguments: -h, --help show this help message and exit -c [CROP], --crop [CROP] crop the output line length We've really just scratched the surface of what can be done here.

All we need to do is first tell the shell that if it encounters this script and is asked to execute it, it needs to use the python3 program. We can do this by putting a shebang at the top of the file: lookup.py #!/usr/bin/env python3# ...the rest of the code goes here, it's been omitted for brevity! This shebang uses the env program to locate the python3 program. This is important as python3 might be installed in different locations on different systems. You can read more about how to use env in shebangs in the chapter Shell Script Essentials under 'Using Shebangs'. Now that we have a shebang, we can make the file executable using the chmod program and link to it from our personal bin folder: chmod +x ~/effective-shell/programs/lookup/lookup.pyln -s ~/effective-shell/programs/lookup/lookup.py /usr/local/bin/lookup If you need a reminder how to use the chmod tool and ln tool to install scripts, check the chapter Shell Script Essentials under the section 'Installing Your Script'. Now that we have the tool in our local binaries folder, we can call it like so: $ lookup -c -- effective shelleffective: A soldier fit for dutyshell: A hard external covering of an animal. Note that the lookup.py script, which is the final version of the script, has some additional features which are described at the end of the chapter. One of these features is that we can just provide a word or list of words as positional arguments to the command. Note that the -- in the command shown above is the 'end of options marker' - this is the standard Linux pattern to indicate that the list of flags is complete, and that what follows is the list of positional parameters. If we didn't have this, the tool would think that we are providing effective as the value of the -c flag. The -- removes this ambiguity. Many Linux tools support this separator, you can check man bash to find out more.","s":"Installing the Lookup Tool","u":"/part-6-advanced-techniques/how-to-avoid-scripting/","h":"#installing-the-lookup-tool","p":893},{"i":912,"t":"One of the fun things about coding is thinking about all of the exciting additional features you can add! The final version of the script, which is in the ~/effective-shell/programs/lookup/lookup.py folder has a set of additional features that you might find useful to explore when building your own programs. These features are: Feature Description More robust error handling There are exception handlers in the key places the program may fail. Graceful handling of Ctrl+C Ensure we close cleanly on Ctrl+C without a noisy error message. See KeyboardInterrupt in the code for this. More detailed help The help text has examples, see argparse in the code. There are all sorts of other features you could add as a coding and learning exercise! Here are a few that I considered: A 'browse' flag - this could open the user's browser to the full definition online Manpages - an option to install a manpage for the tool, meaning that we can run man lookup Clearer interactive mode - when stdin is a terminal, meaning the user is interactive, show a prompt and instructions A verbose flag - a --verbose flag to show detailed error messages if they are encountered If you find yourself writing more complex command-line tools in Python, you might also explore the excellent Click Python package. This is a very popular package among Python developers and is used by a number of large and well-established projects. The Typer package is also worth exploring. The urllib package I have used works, but it can be quite unwieldy when dealing with more complex options - many developers will prefer alternative packages.","s":"Improving the Lookup Program","u":"/part-6-advanced-techniques/how-to-avoid-scripting/","h":"#improving-the-lookup-program","p":893},{"i":914,"t":"In this chapter we looked at alternatives to shell scripts and when we might consider them.

After this happens, the shell performs seven operations on the words, which can change how they are interpreted. These seven operations are collectively known as 'shell expansion'. You are probably familiar with most of them as we have used them throughout this book. The seven operations that the shell performs are: Brace Expansion - expanding values between braces, such as file{1..3} into file1 file2 file3 Tilde Expansion - expanding the ~ tilde symbol for the home directory into the path to the home directory, such as ~/effective-shell into /home/dwmkerr/effective-shell Parameter Expansion - expanding terms that start with a $ symbol into parameter values, such as $HOME into the value of the variable named HOME Command Substitution - evaluation of the contents of $(command) sequences, which are used to run commands and return the results to the shell command line Arithmetic Expansion - evaluation of the contents of $((expression)) sequences, which are used to perform basic mathematical operations Word Splitting - once all of the previous operations are run, the shell splits the command up into 'words', which are the units of text that you can run loops over Pathname Expansion - the shell expands wildcards and special characters in pathnames, such as file*.txt into the set of files that are matched by the sequence If you want to see each of these operations in the manual, you can run man bash and search for the text ^EXPANSION.

We can also create sequences of numbers or characters: touch file{1..5}.txt# The line above is expanded to:touch file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt file4.txt file5.txt You as well as specifying the start and end of a sequence, you can specify the increment, you might see this in for loops like this: for x in {0..10..2}; do print $x; done# The line above is expanded to:for x in 0 2 4 6 8 10; do print $x; done","s":"Brace Expansion","u":"/part-6-advanced-techniques/understanding-shell-expansion/","h":"#brace-expansion","p":932},{"i":941,"t":"If a word starts with a ~ tilde character, then the shell will expand the tilde into the value of the $HOME variable: cd ~/effective-shell# The line above is expanded to:cd $HOME/effective-shell If we were to unset the $HOME variable, then the expansion would use the current user's home directory: unset HOMEcd ~/effective-shell# The line above is expanded to:cd /home/dwmkerr/effective-shell Tilde expansion is very simple!","s":"Tilde Expansion","u":"/part-6-advanced-techniques/understanding-shell-expansion/","h":"#tilde-expansion","p":932},{"i":943,"t":"When the dollar symbol $ is used, this indicates that the shell is going to perform parameter expansion, which expands variables or the parameters of a script. It can also be used to indicate command substitution or arithmetic expansion - which we will see once we've looked at parameter expansion. A lot of these expansions are covered in detail in Chapter 19 - Variables, Reading Input, and Mathematics but I have included each of the available expansions here for reference. In its most simple form, parameter expansion simple replaces the name of a variable or parameter with its value: fruit=applesecho \"I like $fruit\"# The line above is expanded to:echo \"I like apples\" When using parameter expansion it is generally preferable to surround the name of the parameter with braces - this allows you to tell the shell unambiguously what the name of the parameter is. For example: echo \"My backup folder is: ${HOME}backup\"# The line above is expanded to:echo \"My backup folder is: /home/dwmkerrbackup\" If we had not used braces, then the shell would expand the expression like so: echo \"My backup folder is: $HOMEbackup\"# The line above is expanded to:echo \"My backup folder is: \" The reason that the expansion doesn't work as expected in this case is that the shell is trying to expand a parameter with the name HOMEbackup - the braces used in the first example make it clear to the shell that the parameter name is HOME and that the text backup should be added at the end of the expanded value. There are a number of additional features available for parameter expansion that can make it more convenient. Let's look at each of them now. Default Values The expression ${parameter:-default} will expand to the value of the parameter named parameter - but if that value is not set, then the value default is used. This can be convenient if you want to provide a value for the shell to use when a parameter is not set. Assign Default Values The expression ${parameter:=default} will expand to the value of the parameter named parameter - but if that value is not set, then the value default is used. In this case, parameter is also set to default. This means that this expression works just like the 'default values' expression above, but also sets the parameter at the same time. Display Error if Null or Unset The expression ${parameter:?message} tells the shell to expand to the value of parameter, and if that value is null or unset, to instead write the message message to standard error and exit (unless the shell is interactive, in which case the shell is not closed). This can be a convenient way to put a 'guard' in place to ensure that a script aborts if a value is not set. Here's an example of how this can be used: backup_location=${BACKUP_DIR:?Please set BACKUP_DIR to use this script}cp -r ~/effective-shell ${BACKUP_DIR} In this script we copy the ~/effective-shell folder to the folder set in the BACKUP_DIR parameter. However, if that parameter has not been set then the script will abort and show an error message telling the operator that the BACKUP_DIR parameter must be set. Use Alternate Value The expression ${parameter:+alternate} expands to an empty string if parameter is null or unset. However, if parameter has a value, then the value of alternate is used instead. Offset and Length You can tell the shell to expand only a subset of the value of a parameter by using the ${parameter:offset} expression. In this case, the shell will expand the value of parameter, but skip offset number of characters from the beginning: echo \"My home folder name is: ${HOME:6}\"# The line above is expanded to:echo \"My home folder name is: dwmkerr\" You can also specify how many characters should be used by providing a length value after the offset with the expression ${parameter:offset:length}: echo \"The error message is: ${error_message:0:64}\" In the expression above, only up to the first 64 characters of the parameter error_message will be shown. The offset and length values can also be used with arrays: days=(\"Monday\" \"Tuesday\" \"Wednesday\" \"Thursday\" \"Friday\" \"Saturday\" \"Sunday\")echo \"${days[@]:2:3}\"# The line above is expanded to:echo \"Tuesday Wednesday Thursday\" It is important to note that when using this technique with arrays, you must specify the array name and then [@] after the array name, to indicate that you want to work with all of the members of the array. If you don't do this, the entire array is converted into a single string and the resulting string has the offset and length applied. Expand Variable Names The ${!name*} expression evaluates to the name of every parameter that starts with the text name. You can use this expression to find the full set of parameters that match a certain pattern. How might this be useful? One nice trick is to use it to tidy up scripts. For example, if you are writing a script and create a set of variables for internal use, you could use this expression to find the names of all of the variables you have created and clean them up: _es_download_folder=~/downloads_es_backup_folder=~/backups_es_download_address=https://effective-shell.com/downloads/effective-shell-samples.tar.gz# At this point we might have a script that uses the variables above...# Now clean up any variables we created.for var_name in ${!_es_*}do echo \"Cleaning up: ${var_name}...\" unset ${var_name}done This is rather an advanced technique but it does show how the 'expand variable names' expansion can be useful. Array Expansion This topic is covered in detail in Chapter 19. The expression ${!array[@} expands to the indices (or 'keys') for each item in an array: days=(\"Monday\" \"Tuesday\" \"Wednesday\" \"Thursday\" \"Friday\" \"Saturday\" \"Sunday\")echo \"${!days[@]}\"# The line above is expanded to:echo \"0 1 2 3 4 5 6\" This expansion is convenient if you do not know the keys that make up an array and want to loop through them. Parameter Length The ${#parameter} expression expands to the length of the value in the parameter named parameter. You can also use this expression to find the length of an array - just add the [@] subscript like so ${#array[@]}: days=(\"Monday\" \"Tuesday\" \"Wednesday\" \"Thursday\" \"Friday\" \"Saturday\" \"Sunday\")echo \"There are ${#days[@]} days in the array\"# The line above is expanded to:echo \"There are 7 days in the array\" You may have noticed at pattern by this point - many of the expansions that can be performed on a parameter can also be performed on an array, just by adding the [@] subscript to the parameter name. Think of this subscript as saying 'all of the array members' - without it the shell combines all of the array members into a single string and performs the substitution on the result. Remove Pattern from Front You can use the ${parameter#pattern} expression to expand the value of parameter, removing pattern from the front of the value: address=https://effective-shell.comecho \"Address: ${address#https://}\"# The line above is expanded to:echo \"Address: effective-shell.com\" You can also tell the shell to remove as many sequential matches of pattern as possible, by using the ${parameter##pattern} expression. This can be useful to strip out all of the characters up to a certain point in a parameter: folder=/home/dwmkerr/backups/2021-10-19echo \"Today's backup folder is: ${folder##*/}\"# The line above is expanded to:echo \"Today's backup folder is: 2021-10-19\" Notice that in this example we are using an asterisk * symbol in the pattern, telling the shell to strip as many possible characters from the beginning of the parameter up until the final forward-slash / is found. Remove Pattern from Back The ${parameter%pattern} expression works exactly like the expression above, but removes text from the end of a parameter: echo \"My working directory is: ${PWD}\"echo \"My parent folder is: ${PWD%/*}\"# The lines above are expanded to:echo \"My working directory is: /home/dwmkerr/repos/github/dwmkerr/effective-shell\"echo \"My parent folder is: /home/dwmkerr/repos/github/dwmkerr\" In this example we used an asterisk * wildcard in the pattern to remove all of the text from the back of the parameter, up to and including the first forward-slash / symbol found. We can also remove as many matches as possible, by using the expression ${parameter%%pattern}: archive=effective-shell.tar.gzecho \"Name of archive is: ${archive%%.*}\"# The line above is expanded to:echo \"Name of archive is: effective-shell\" Notice that in this case the removal of the characters did not stop at the first period . symbol, it removed as many characters as possible until the last period . symbol was found. Pattern Replacement You can also replace a pattern in a parameter by using the expression ${parameter/pattern/string}. This can be used to perform substitutions: message=\"Hello Dave\"echo \"${message/Hello/Goodbye}\"# The line above is expanded to:echo \"Goodbye Dave\" There are actually a number of options available for Pattern Replacement that can control things like the number of replacements that are performed and how arrays are treated. I would recommend not using overly complex replacements using these types of expressions though - instead use a command like tr or sed to make it very explicit what is going on - the built-in shell parameter replacement can be quite complex for the reader to parse and can also vary from shell to shell. For suggestions on alternative ways to manipulate text check Chapter 15 - Slice and Dice Text or Chapter 16 - Advanced Text Manipulation with Sed. Lowercase or Uppercase You can use the ${parameter^^} expression to return the value of parameter converted to uppercase. You can also use the ${parameter,,} expression to return the value of parameter converted to lowercase. An example is below: message=\"Hello Reader\"echo ${message^^}echo ${message,,} The output of this script is: HELLO READERhello reader Parameter Indirection If you want to get the value of a parameter that has an arbitrary name you can use the ${!parameter_name} expression. This will return the value of the parameter that has the name of the value of parameter_name - you can see this in action like so: parameter_name=\"HOME\"echo \"${!parameter_name}\" The output of this script is: /home/dwmkerr This can be very useful if you are writing scripts that will work with arbitrary or variable parameter names. You can see more examples of how parameter expansion works, and in particular how to use parameter expansion with the parameters to functions or scripts in Chapter 19 - Variables, Reading Input, and Mathematics.","s":"Parameter Expansion","u":"/part-6-advanced-techniques/understanding-shell-expansion/","h":"#parameter-expansion","p":932},{"i":945,"t":"The second form of expansion that starts with a dollar $ symbol is command substitution. This form of expansion instructs the shell to run a specific command. The syntax is simply $(comand). We have seen command substitution throughout the book - in the example below we expand the date command to print the current date: echo \"The date is: $(date)\"# The line above is expanded to:echo \"The date is: Tue Oct 19 16:49:07 +08 2021\" You may find that your scripts or commands are easier to manage if you store the results of a command in a variable like so: archives=$(find ~/downloads -type f -name \"*.tar.gz\") In this command we store the results of the find operation in the parameter named archives. There is an alternative syntax for command substitution that you might see. In this alternative syntax the command is surrounded by backtick symbol. The command above could be written like so: archives=`find ~/downloads -type f -name \"*.tar.gz\"` You may see this syntax from time to time, however I would suggest that you avoid it. The reason is that you cannot nest commands using this syntax. If you want to run a command that itself performs command substitution it is not possible to do so with this backtick syntax. Instead, prefer the form that uses parentheses - such as result=$(command1 $(command2)).","s":"Command Substitution","u":"/part-6-advanced-techniques/understanding-shell-expansion/","h":"#command-substitution","p":932},{"i":947,"t":"The final form of shell expansion that starts with a dollar symbol $ is arithmetic expansion. This expansion can be used to perform simple arithmetic expressions: echo \"The result of 23*4 is: $((23*4))\"echo \"The result of 23*4 is: 92\" Arithmetic expansion is covered in detail in Chapter 19 - Variables, Reading Input, and Mathematics.","s":"Arithmetic Expansion","u":"/part-6-advanced-techniques/understanding-shell-expansion/","h":"#arithmetic-expansion","p":932},{"i":949,"t":"Word splitting is a complex topic that can often cause confusion. Word splitting is the process that the shell goes through when it takes the results of parameter expansion, command substitution and arithmetic expansion and then attempts to split the result into 'words'. The easiest way to remember which expansions have word splitting applied are that it is applied to any expansion that starts with a dollar symbol $ and that does not occur within double quotes. The fact that word splitting only occurs if a substitution does not use double quotes can also cause confusion. Let's take a look into word splitting in detail and see when it is useful and when it can be problematic. To see word splitting in action, we'll run a command that returns a set of words. In the example note that there are different numbers of space characters between some of the days: days=\"Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday\"for day in \"$days\"do echo \"${day}\"done The output of this script is: Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday In the expression for day in \"$day\" we are using shell parameter expansion to expand the days parameter. We have surrounded $day in quotes - this means that we are telling the shell not to apply any word splitting. This means the shell preserves the spaces in the parameter. When we loop through the parameter we have one value only - the original set of days, including the spaces, that we set in the parameter. Now let's run the same script but this time we will not surround $days in quotes, meaning that the shell will perform word splitting: days=\"Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday\"for day in $daysdo echo \"${day}\"done The output of this script is: MondayTuesdayWednesdayThursdayFridaySaturdaySunday In this case we can see that word splitting has occurred. The shell has performed the following operations: First, it searches through each character in the input Every time it finds a character in the IFS (Input Field Separator) special variable, it splits the word If there are multiple instances of a separator character, they are removed, and replaced with a single instance only By default, the IFS variable is set to <space><tab><newline>. This means that any spaces, tabs or newline characters in the input are considered as characters that the shell will use to split words. As you can see from the example above, when we have multiple instances of these characters sequentially (such as the five space characters after the Wednesday value), they are replaced with a single instance of the first character (a space in this case) and then the splitting occurs. The fact that the shell uses spaces, tabs and newlines as input field separators can sometimes cause confusion - in particular if you have a list of files: programs=\"/usr/bin/bash /usr/bin/zshell /usr/bin/new shell\"for program in $programsdo echo \"${program}\"done The output of this script is: /usr/bin/bash/usr/bin/zshell/usr/bin/newshell The final command, which has a space in the name, has been split into two words. You could avoid this issue by temporarily changing the value of IFS to use a different separator for words: programs=\"/usr/bin/bash;/usr/bin/zshell;/usr/bin/new shell\"OLDIFS=$IFSIFS=';'for program in $programsdo echo \"${program}\"doneIFS=$OLDIFS The output of this script is: /usr/bin/bash/usr/bin/zshell/usr/bin/new shell In this script we saved the original value of IFS into a parameter called OLDIFS, changed IFS to use a semi-colon as a separator, ran the loop (which correctly split the programs and preserved the space in the last program name) then change IFS back to its original value. You should be careful when changing IFS to make sure that you change it back to its original value straight afterwards - other programs or commands might expect IFS to be set to the default value so it should only be changed with caution. If you were to look at the contents of the PATH variable, which specifies the locations the shell should search for commands, you will see that they are actually separated by colons: $ echo $PATH/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games The results you see will vary depending on your operating system. But the fact that they are separated by colons means that you can easily change IFS to a colon character to get each of the paths - even if they contain spaces: OLDIFS=$IFSIFS=\":\"for path in $PATHdo echo \"${path}\"doneIFS=$OLDIFS The output of this script will look something like this: /usr/local/sbin/usr/local/bin/usr/sbin/usr/bin/sbin/bin/usr/games/usr/local/games We will see a little more about how the shell can sometimes split up a filename with spaces (or even newlines) in the path when we look at the final shell expansion - pathname expansion.","s":"Word Splitting","u":"/part-6-advanced-techniques/understanding-shell-expansion/","h":"#word-splitting","p":932},{"i":951,"t":"When the shell encounters the asterisk *, question mark ? or open square brackets [ characters, it marks the beginning of an expression that will have pathname expansion applied to it. We have actually seen pathname expansion a number of times in this book - it is the expansion that occurs when we use wildcards or patterns in shell scripts to expand a list of paths: $ ls ~/downloads/*.tar.gz/home/dwmkerr/downloads/aspnetcore-runtime-3.1.18-osx-x64 (1).tar.gz/home/dwmkerr/downloads/aspnetcore-runtime-3.1.18-osx-x64.tar.gz/home/dwmkerr/downloads/dotnet-sdk-3.1.412-osx-x64.tar.gz/home/dwmkerr/downloads/effective-shell-playground.tar.gz/home/dwmkerr/downloads/effective-shell-samples (1).tar.gz/home/dwmkerr/downloads/effective-shell-samples (2).tar.gz/home/dwmkerr/downloads/effective-shell-samples.tar.gz This script shows all of the files in the ~/downloads folder that match the pattern *.tar.gz. The results you see will depend on what you have in your own ~/downloads folder! It is important to remember that the shell performs all of the types of expansion that we have described in order. This means that word expansion is performed before pathname expansion. So if you loop through the results of an expanded path, word splitting will not be performed on those results. We can see that with the script below: for $path in ~/downloads/*.tar.gzdo echo \"${path}\"done The result of this script is: /home/dwmkerr/downloads/aspnetcore-runtime-3.1.18-osx-x64 (1).tar.gz/home/dwmkerr/downloads/aspnetcore-runtime-3.1.18-osx-x64.tar.gz/home/dwmkerr/downloads/dotnet-sdk-3.1.412-osx-x64.tar.gz/home/dwmkerr/downloads/effective-shell-playground.tar.gz/home/dwmkerr/downloads/effective-shell-samples (1).tar.gz/home/dwmkerr/downloads/effective-shell-samples (2).tar.gz/home/dwmkerr/downloads/effective-shell-samples.tar.gz Note that the spaces in the path names have been preserved - pathname expansion happens after word splitting - so the paths themselves are left as-is. As well as the asterisk * character, which can be used as a wildcard character in pathname expansion, there is also the question mark ? character which means 'any single character'. You can also use expressions such as [abc] to match on a range of characters. The exact details of how these special characters are used can be found in man bash. One feature of pathname expansion that people can sometimes be surprised by is what happens if the shell finds no files that match the pattern. You can see this in action below: $ echo ~/effective-shell/*.txt/home/dwmkerr/effective-shell/*.txt There are no files in the ~/effective-shell folder that match the pattern *.txt and in this case the shell has left the text as-is. This means that you should always check the results of the expansion before assuming that the shell has found a file! For example, if I wanted to run the touch command on a set of files, I would do the following: for file in ~/effective-shell/*.txt # If the file / folder doesn't exist, skip it. if ! [ -e \"$file\" ]; then continue; fi touch \"$file\"do In this script we first check to see whether the file or folder exists by using the -e test. If the file or folder doesn't exist then we skip through the loop. You can see more examples of this pattern in Chapter 21 - Loops and working with Files and Folders.
